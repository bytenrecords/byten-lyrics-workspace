I will review the final lyrics from Megan and Essoria and select the strongest version.

### Comparison of Submissions:

#### **Megan's Lyrics:**
- **Overall Structure:** Same as Essoria's, with no noticeable differences in lines or flow.
- **Language Quality:** Contains broken characters (e.g., "canâ€™t") which detracts from readability.

#### **Essoria's Lyrics:**
- **Overall Structure:** Identical to Megan's submission.
- **Language Quality:** Corrected broken characters, resulting in cleaner text.

### Evaluation:
Both submissions are thematically identical, but Essoria's version is free of character errors, enhancing clarity and presentation. Therefore, it is the stronger version.

### **Selected Version:**
I’ll proceed with **Essoria's lyrics** for "Spark the Night" as the final choice for production.
