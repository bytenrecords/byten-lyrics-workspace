Chasing rainbows in the sky,  
Let’s laugh, let’s sing, let our spirits fly!  
With every note, we paint the air,  
Together, darling, we’re a breath of flair!  

**[Hook]**  
Oh, oh, let’s chase those beams of light,  
We’re the stars that sparkle so bright!

With friends beside, we’ll paint the night,  
Adventures waiting, everything feels right.  
Inspiration flowing, like a river wide,  
With every moment, let’s take a ride!

Chasing rainbows in the sky,  
Let’s laugh, let’s sing, let our spirits fly!  
With every note, we paint the air,
