Iâ€™ll review the final lyric drafts once they are accessible. To expedite the process, please ensure the following actions are taken:

1. Use either Notepad++ or Sublime Text to check and open the drafts properly.
2. If that does not resolve the issue, copy the visible content directly here for me to evaluate.
3. If the content remains inaccessible, have Megan resend the lyrics via email to bytenrecords+byten@gmail.com.

I will then objectively assess the drafts and select the strongest one for our project. Thank you.
