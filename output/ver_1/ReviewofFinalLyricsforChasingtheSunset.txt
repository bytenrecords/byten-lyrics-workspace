**Review of Final Lyrics for "Chasing the Sunset"**

**Option 1: Megan's Lyrics**  
- **Intro:** [Instrumental]  
- **Verse 1:**  
Underneath the stars, we find our way,  
Whispers in the night, we’re here to play.  
With every heartbeat, we break the mold,  
In a world of colors, our story unfolds.
  
- **Chorus:**  
Chasing the sunset, we dance on the edge,  
Lost in the moment, no need for a pledge.  
These nights feel electric, hearts in sync,  
We’re writing our story, just let it all ink.

- **Hook:**  
Whoa-oh, let it crash, let it burn,  
Feel the magic, it’s our turn.  
Whoa-oh, with every dream we chase,  
Living wild in this endless space.

- **Verse 2:**  
Glancing at the city, lights flash like dreams,  
Never know how far, but we’re bursting at the seams.  
Take a breath, feel the rhythm in our veins,  
Through laughter and tears, we’ll dance in the rain.

- **Chorus:**  
Chasing the sunset, we dance on the edge,  
Lost in the moment, no need for a pledge.  
These nights feel electric, hearts in sync,  
We’re writing our story, just let it all ink.

- **Bridge:**  
In shadows we rise, together we’ll soar,  
The world is our canvas, we’ll paint it with more.  
Every note we play, a piece of our heart,  
Countless memories, where the magic starts.

- **Chorus:**  
Chasing the sunset, we dance on the edge,  
Lost in the moment, no need for a pledge.  
These nights feel electric, hearts in sync,  
We’re writing our story, just let it all ink.

- **Outro:** [Instrumental fade-out]  
- **Music Styles:** Alternative R&B, Dream Pop, Indie Electronic, Chill Hop, Neo-Soul
