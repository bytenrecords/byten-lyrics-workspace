I will review the final lyrics provided above and choose the strongest version quickly and efficiently. 

### Review of Final Versions:
1. **Essoria**  
2. **Meganlyc**

### Assessment:
Both versions contain similar content, including lyrics and structure. The most notable difference is the presence of refinements and suggestions in the **Essoria** output, which helps improve clarity and musicality. The **Meganlyc** version lacks these enhancements and presents the lyrics with less correction of encoding errors.

### Decision:
**Select: Essoria**  
**Reason:** The inclusion of refinements aids in creating a more polished and inviting song experience, making it the superior choice.
