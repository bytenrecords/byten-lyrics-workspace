**Subject:** Review and Selection of Final Lyrics for "Neon Nights"

I have reviewed the final lyrics submitted by Isadora, Kyoichi, Megan, and the initial idea proposed by Stan. Here’s a concise evaluation:

1. **Clarity & Structure:** All submissions maintain the song structure effectively. Verses, choruses, and hooks flow logically with a consistent theme throughout.

2. **Imagery & Emotion:** Megan's draft stands out with its vivid imagery and emotional appeal. Phrases such as "dancing in the rain" and "together we rise under neon lights" engage the audience effectively.

3. **Cohesion:** The contributions seamlessly connect the elements of urban romance with a lively atmosphere. Kyoichi’s suggestions for dynamic shifts and language integration enhance the narrative depth.

4. **Lyrics Integration:** Isadora’s updates introduce valuable narrative twists while retaining a catchy essence.

**Recommendation:**
- Select the finalized version from **Megan** as it provides a complementary balance of lyrical beauty and thematic depth. Minor tweaks can be further made to enhance flow and rhythm based on Kyoichi’s suggestions and Isadora's integration efforts.

Proceeding with Megan’s version for finalization while incorporating selected enhancements does not detract from the original charm and will appeal to the cross-cultural theme highlighted in Andrew's email.

Best,
