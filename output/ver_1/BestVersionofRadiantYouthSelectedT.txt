**Title:** Radiant Youth  

**[Intro] [Instrumental]**  

**[Verse 1]:**  
In the city lights, we shine,  
Chasing dreams, a steady climb,  
Heartbeats sync to rhythm's flow,  
Let’s break the mold, let’s let it show.  

**[Chorus]:**  
We’re young and wild, no limits in sight,  
With every step, igniting the night.  
Feel the bass, let it take control,  
In this moment, we’re alive and whole.  

**[Hook]:**  
Oh, we’re dancing through the chaos,  
Unfolding like a vibrant flower,  
Catching sparks, we’re unstoppable,  
Our energy is pure power!  

**[Verse 2]:**  
From rooftops high, we’ll share our truth,  
Living loud, embracing youth.  
Whispers of love in neon beams,  
In this wild ride, let go of dreams!  

**[Bridge]:**  
So let’s fly, let’s rise above,  
Surrounded by stars and a world full of love.  
We’ll chart our own course, never conform,  
In this song of life, we’ll dance through the storm.  

**[Chorus]:**  
We’re young and wild, no limits in sight,  
With every step, igniting the night.  
Feel the bass, let it take control,  
In this moment, we’re alive and whole.
