**Subject:** Review of "Unbound Echoes" Lyrics

Hi Team,

After reviewing all final lyric submissions for "Unbound Echoes," I have scanned through the versions from Andrew, Essoria, and Megan. Kyoichitsu's entry could not be processed. 

Based on a matter-of-fact evaluation of clarity, emotional resonance, and thematic cohesion, the strongest version is the following:

---

**Title: Unbound Echoes**

**[Intro] [Instrumental]**  
(A gentle electric piano introduces the vibe, gradually blending in rhythmic layers)

**[Verse 1]**  
"Lost in the echoes of my mind,  
Chasing the fragments left behind.  
In a world that hums and shouts,  
I’ll weave through the noise, no doubts."

**[Chorus]**  
"Hey, I’m unbound,  
Shattering illusions draped in despair.  
Hearing my sound,  
In colors that dance through the air."

**[Hook]**  
"Let’s rejoice, for we are alive,  
In this moment, we truly thrive.  
Dare to shine, just like the stars,  
We’re crafting our own memoirs."

**[Verse 2]**  
"Turning the pages, rewriting fate,  
Illuminating paths through love and hate.  
Our essence flickers in the night,  
Together, we’ll ignite the light."

**[Chorus]**  
"Hey, I’m unbound,  
Shattering illusions draped in despair.  
Hearing my sound,  
In colors that dance through the air."

**[Outro] [Instrumental]**  
(Gradually fading out with rich harmonies and a smooth, rhythmic beat)

This version captures the desired themes and connects well with the intended audience. Next steps should involve any final adjustments as discussed.
