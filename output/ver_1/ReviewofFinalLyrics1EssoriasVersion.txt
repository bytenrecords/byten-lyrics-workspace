**Review of Final Lyrics**

1. **Essoria's Version**:  
   - Pros: Maintains a joyful and uplifting tone; lyrics are vivid and create a sense of movement and freedom.  
   - Cons: Contains multiple instances of "â€™" which is a result of encoding errors.

2. **Meganlyc's Version**:  
   - Pros: Similar uplifting tone; the idea of joy and dance is well-represented.   
   - Cons: Also contains instances of "â€™" due to encoding issues.

**Conclusion**:  
While both versions capture the spirit of the song well, I recommend a final revision to correct encoding errors and enhance clarity. 

### Recommendation: Use **Essoria's Version** as the base due to its slightly richer imagery and rhythm. Clean up the encoding errors and finalize the text.

### Final Selection Process:
- Proceed to correct errors in Essoria's version.
- Ensure that all lyrics maintain a clear and coherent presentation for performance.

**Action Required**: Finalize the corrections.
