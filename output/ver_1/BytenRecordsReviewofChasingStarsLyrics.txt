**[Verse 1]:**  
In the city lights, where dreams ignite,  
We chase the stars, we’ll be alright.  
Got each other’s backs, through every fight,  
Let’s make some noise, bring our hearts to life.

---

**[Chorus]:**  
We’re the generation, breaking the mold,  
With every beat, watch our story unfold.  
Dancing on the edge, feeling so bold,  
Together we rise, let the future be told.

---

**[Hook]:**  
Oh, oh, we’re alive tonight,  
With every heartbeat, we're taking flight.  
Oh, oh, under the neon glow,  
Hand in hand, we’ll steal the show!

---

**[Verse 2]:**  
Through the whispers of dreams that we chased,  
We color the sky, no moment goes to waste.  
With hopes like fire, we’ll light up the space,  
In this rhythm of love, we’ll always find grace.

**[Chorus]:**  
We’re the generation, breaking the mold,  
With every beat, watch our story unfold.  
Dancing on the edge, feeling so bold,  
Together we rise, let the future be told.

---

**[Bridge]:**  
In the cherry blossoms, we find our way,  
Words unspoken, in the games we play.  
With laughter echoing like a sweet serenade,  
Our love’s a language, never afraid.

---

**[Chorus]:**  
We’re the generation, breaking the mold,  
With every beat, watch our story unfold.  
Dancing on the edge, feeling so bold,  
Together we rise, let the future be told.
