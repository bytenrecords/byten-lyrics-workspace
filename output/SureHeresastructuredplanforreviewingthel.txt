     Hi Team,

     I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share some feedback regarding our current lyric reviews. Iâ€™ve noticed a significant opportunity to prioritize our efforts on creating Chinese songs, which can resonate powerfully with our target audience.

     I propose we emphasize songs with cultural references and emotional depth that reflect Chinese values. Additionally, we should consider organizing sessions to brainstorm new lyrical ideas and compositions that highlight these themes.

     Let's schedule a time to discuss this further. Your input would be invaluable in refining our creative direction!

     Best, 
     [Your Name]
     Byten Records
     ```

5. **Discuss Next Steps:**
   - Set up a meeting with the team to flesh out strategies for enhancing the focus on Chinese music creation.
   - Encourage collaboration with artists to brainstorm ideas and share cultural insights that can influence future projects.
