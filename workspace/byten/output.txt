**Subject:** Review of Final Lyrics for Upcoming Track

I will now proceed to review all final lyrics and choose the strongest version.

1. **Access the lyrics**: Due to ongoing technical issues, I will wait for resolution from the team regarding the access to the lyrics submitted by Megan and suggestions from Kyoichitsu.

2. **Evaluation of Text**: Once the files are accessible, I will:
   - Identify strengths in the lyrics.
   - Assess emotional impact and imagery.
   - Check for natural flow and rhythm.
   - Compare multiple versions if necessary.

3. **Selection**: I will choose the best lyrics based on a concise evaluation.

Until access is restored, thereâ€™s nothing further to act upon at this moment.

**Best,
