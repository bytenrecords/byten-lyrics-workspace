Subject: Review of "Electric Dreams" Lyrics

The lyrics for "Electric Dreams" have been compiled and reviewed. Here are the key observations:

### Strong Aspects:
- **Consistency**: The lyrics maintain a cohesive theme of dreaming and striving, which aligns well with the chosen music styles (Alternative R&B, Smooth Jazz, etc.).
- **Imagery**: Vivid descriptions such as "neon lights" and "shadows dance" create a resonant urban atmosphere.
- **Repetitive Structure**: The repeated chorus emphasizes the upbeat and optimistic message, making it catchy.

### Observations:
- **Intro and Outro Flow**: These sections are effective in framing the piece but can be slightly more dynamic to enhance impact.
- **Bridge**: Strong message, but consider tightening the phrasing for clarity and rhythm.

### Suggested Edits:
- Review the lines where imagery may be enhanced for greater emotional connection.
- Consider small tweaks for rhythm in the bridge to ensure it meshes well with the rest.

### Conclusion:
The lyrics capture the essence required for the track. I recommend finalizing the current version, implementing slight adjustments based on the above observations, and moving forward to production.

- **Final Choice**: I will select this version as the strongest among the submissions I have access to.
