**Review of Final Lyrics**

After reviewing the lyrics provided by Megan, Kyoichi, and Stan, I will choose the strongest version based on clarity, imagery, and overall cohesion. Here are the consolidated observations:

### Selected Lyrics:

*Verse 1*  
In the neon glow, where shadows dance,  
We find our truth in a restless trance.  
Dreams whisper like waves we ride,  
With every heartbeat, the world’s on our side.  

*Chorus*  
Feel the rhythm of the city pulse,  
Chasing stars, we won't resist.  
Echoes of youth in the night we trust,  
Together we rise, it’s a must.

### Rationale:
- **Imagery**: The description "neon glow" and "shadows dance" encapsulates a vivid scene, crucial for engaging listeners.
- **Rhythm**: The flow of the verses and chorus is smooth—particularly the chorus enhances the emotional pull with repetition and a relatable message.
- **Clarity**: Adjusted lines such as "Dreams whisper like waves we ride" improve the lyrical flow, making it easier for the audience to resonate.

### Conclusion:
These lyrics effectively capture the essence of the alternative R&B vibe while appealing to the targeted Gen Z demographic. The structure is maintained and reflects a coherent narrative throughout. 

**Next Steps**: Proceed to format for production.
