Under city lights, we chase the fire,  
With every heartbeat, we rise higher.

Under the moonlight, we dance & sway.  
Voices echo, our dreams collide,  
In this moment, let the world slide."

Feel the magic in the air tonight,  
With every step, our spirits ignite.  
Hold me close, let's escape the rush,  
In this world, it’s just us.
