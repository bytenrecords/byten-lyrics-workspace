**Review of Final Lyrics for "Chasing Daydreams":**

1. **Andrew Pan's Version:**  
   - **Strengths:** Strong imagery in the intro and verses. The use of "hearts wide open" in the chorus is impactful.
   - **Suggestions:** Minor edits in the hook to improve rhythm; consider using "like wildfire" instead of "like wild fire" for cohesion.

2. **Essoria's Version:**  
   - **Strengths:** Great flow and consistent theme. "Every step a dance, laughter in the breeze" works well rhythmically.
   - **Suggestions:** The phrase "let’s take that ride" could be replaced with a more imaginative expression.

3. **Megan Lyc's Version:**  
   - **Strengths:** Evocative language with beautiful imagery throughout. "Finding hidden paths" and "In this beautiful chaos" are particularly engaging.
   - **Suggestions:** The phrase "let’s keep it fun!" may undermine the deeper sentiment intended; consider refining.

**Conclusion:**  
Andrew Pan's version is the strongest overall for its blend of anchor points and lyrical balance, with slight modifications suggested for polish. Final selection: Andrew Pan's version.

**Action:**
