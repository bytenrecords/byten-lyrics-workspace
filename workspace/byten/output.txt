### Final Selected Song Lyrics:

**[intro] [instrumental]**  
In this crowded room, I feel alone,  
Chasing shadows beneath the city dome.  
Footsteps echo, dreams whispering clear,  
Searching for a melody only we hear.  

**[verse 1]**  
Fading laughter, whispers in the night,  
Scrolling through memories, lost in the light.  
We wear our colors, bright yet discreet,  
Finding our voice in chaos, bittersweet.  

**[chorus]**  
Raise your hands up, don’t be shy,  
We’re all stars in this endless sky.  
Together in rhythm, breaking the mold,  
In a world of grey, let's let our truth be bold.  

**[verse 2]**  
Crossing borders, tales to unfold,  
From crayons to canvases, let dreams be told.  
Waves of resilience, we’ll ride the tide,  
Hand in hand, let’s take this wild ride.  

**[bridge]**  
The night whispers secrets, we'll dance with the past,  
Illuminated futures, let the shadows be cast.  
Every heartbeat echoes, we rise from the ground,  
With love as our anthem, let our voices resound.  

**[hook]**  
Oh, we’re young, wild, and free,  
Writing our anthem, just you and me.  
With every heartbeat, we'll shine and soar,  
Empowered by the love we explore.
