**Kyoichitsu's Review of Megan's Draft for "City Lights and Crown"**

---

**Overall Impression:**
Megan's lyrics capture a youthful spirit, reflecting themes of self-discovery and resilience amidst the chaos. The flow is smooth and engaging, with relatable sentiments that resonate well with listeners.

### Strengths:
1. **Relatable Themes:** The lyrics address universal experiences of searching for identity and belonging, which will likely connect with a wide audience.
   
2. **Chorus Quality:** The chorus has a nostalgic feel, offering a strong emotional anchor that reinforces the message of looking back at joyful moments. It’s catchy and memorable, which is crucial for a song.
   
3. **Imagery:** Lines like "Lost in the city lights, chasing dreams" evoke strong visuals and emotions, helping the listener to immerse themselves in the narrative.

### Areas for Improvement:
1. **Verse Flow:** While the verses are compelling, some lines could be tweaked for rhythm. For instance, consider tightening the phrasing to enhance the lyrical flow. The transition to “Let’s break free, no more pretense” could have smoother synergy with the preceding lines.

2. **Pacing in the Hook:** The hook could benefit from a slight reordering or slight changes in wording to improve clarity and engagement. The emphatic nature of “Let’s dance until we lose our scars” might flow more seamlessly with varied phrasing.

3. **Bridge Addition:** I appreciate Stan’s addition in the bridge, which deepens the narrative and provides a moment of reflection. This can serve as a nice contrast to the verses and enhance the overall journey of the song.

### Suggested Tweaks:
- **Verse 1 Modifications:**
  Instead of:
  *“Filters and faÃ§ades, theyâ€™re weighing me down,”*  
  Consider:  
  *“Filters and façades, they weigh heavy on me,”*

- **Chorus Streamlining:**
  Instead of:  
  *“Can we just rewind, to the moments weâ€™d find”*  
  Try:  
  *“Can we rewind to moments defined,”*  

- **Consolidated Hook:**
  Instead of:  
  *“With every heartbeat, itâ€™s a brand new day.”*  
  Perhaps shift to:  
  *“With every heartbeat, new dreams lead the way.”*  

### Conclusion:
Megan's draft is off to a strong start with the potential for a really impactful track. By making a few adjustments to enhance lyrical flow and integrating elements of the suggested bridge, we can elevate the song further to resonate even deeper with our audience. I'm excited to see how we all collaborate to refine and perfect this piece!
