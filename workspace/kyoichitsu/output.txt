**Subject: Feedback on "Echoes of Yesterday" Lyrics**

Hi Megan,

I’ve had the chance to review your lyrics for “Echoes of Yesterday,” and I really appreciate the emotional depth and the vivid imagery you’ve employed throughout the song. The theme of love and connection is beautifully conveyed, and it suits the alternative R&B and dream pop styles we aim to achieve. Here are a few suggestions for improvement:

### Improvement Ideas:

1. **Vivid Imagery Enhancements**: 
   - In Verse 1, consider replacing "shadows start to play" with a more specific image. Perhaps something like, "shadows weave their tales" or "nightfall dances through the trees." This could strengthen the visual aspect of the scene.
   
2. **Definitive Language**: 
   - The line "Chasing dreams together, we’ll find our way" could be more assertive. You might say, "Chasing dreams together, we’ll carve our path," to emphasize determination.

3. **Repetition and Variation**:
   - The chorus is strong, but you could play with the structure a bit. Perhaps alternate a line or two in the second chorus to showcase growth or development in the relationship. For instance, "With every beat, our hearts awakens" could be changed to "With every beat, our fire's unshaken."

4. **Bridge Expansion**: 
   - The bridge is compelling; however, I think it could benefit from a slight expansion. You could add a reflective line, transitioning from “So let the music take control” to “Lost in the rhythm, we’ll never fall” to imply trust in each other and the journey.

5. **Hook Repetition**:
   - The hook is fairly succinct, which works well. Consider repeating the key message or phrase later in the song to enhance memorability. Perhaps repeating the phrase "break away" at the end of verse 2 could add a nice touch.

### General Thoughts:
Overall, these lyrics are heading in a lovely direction and capture the essence of the style you're aiming for. Little tweaks here and there can enhance the emotional resonance and imagery that will engage listeners even more. 

Feel free to reach out if you’d like to brainstorm more ideas together. I really enjoy collaborating with you and I’m excited to see where we take these lyrics next!

Best,
