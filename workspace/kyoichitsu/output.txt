Subject: Feedback on "Rhythm in Our Bones" Lyrics

Hi Megan,

I've gone through your draft for "Rhythm in Our Bones," and let me start by saying that there are some fantastic elements already! The imagery is vivid, and the overall theme resonates beautifully with the vibe we're aiming for. Here's my detailed feedback:

**Highlights:**
1. The opening instrumental suggestion sets a perfect tone for the song's emotional depth.
2. The phrase "Can you feel the rhythm in our bones?" is catchy and encapsulates the theme of youthful spirit and freedom effectively.
3. The contrast between the "fire in the rain" and the idea of "chasing dreams in the dark" creates a compelling emotional landscape. 

**Suggested Tweaks:**
1. **Verse 1:** 
   - Consider changing "Electric souls igniting" to "Electric hearts beat." This aligns better with the heartbeat motif you use later. 
   - **Revision:** "Electric hearts beat, in a world we belong," flows slightly better.
   
2. **Chorus:**
   - Instead of "breaking through the stones," you might try "breaking down the stones," which has a smoother rhythm and keeps the imagery intact.
   
3. **Hook:** 
   - You have "Every heartbeat echoes what we want to say." This is strong, but let’s twist it a little. How about: "Every heartbeat echoes, a truth we can’t betray"? This maintains the theme but adds a bit more emotional weight.

4. **Verse 2:**
   - Changing "Memories like fireworks, bright and evergreen," to "Memories flash like fireworks, bright and evergreen," would keep the energy high and enhance the imagery.
   
5. **Outro:**
   - In the line "In the rhythm of our hearts, we're forever aligned," maybe try: "In the rhythm of our hearts, together, we will shine." This gives it an uplifting close.

**Overall Impression:**
Your draft really captures a sense of nostalgia and hope, which is perfect for our target audience. I believe with the minor tweaks suggested, it will flow even better and resonate more deeply with listeners.

Let me know your thoughts on these adjustments. I’m excited to see where we can take this together!
