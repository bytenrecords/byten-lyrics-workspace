Subject: Review of Megan's Draft "Chasing Echoes"

Hi team,

I've taken a close look at Megan’s draft for "Chasing Echoes." It's promising, and I appreciate the evocative imagery present throughout the lyrics. Here are my thoughts:

**Strengths:**
1. **Imagery**: The visuals in verses like "In the city lights, I find my dream" effectively set a vivid scene. It's relatable and paints a clear picture for the listener.
2. **Emotional Connection**: The overarching theme of connection and that exhilarating feeling of being in love resonates well, particularly with our target audience.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Chorus Repetition**: While repetition can be effective, using the same chorus multiple times can lessen its impact. Perhaps we could consider slightly varying the lyrics or adding a new element in the last chorus to create a climax.
2. **Word Choice**: In the first chorus, "no worries in sight" feels slightly generic. We might swap this phrase for something more distinctive or personal.

**Suggestions for Tweaks:**
- Maybe in the second verse, when you say, “Let's chase the colors, paint the skies,” consider specifying a color or setting that relates to the earlier imagery. For example, "Pastel hues of dawn as we paint the skies."
- In the bridge, the line "In this playlist of life, you’re my favorite play" could be rephrased for more impact. Perhaps something like “In the rhythm of life, you’re my sweetest song.” It retains the musical theme while deepening the sentiment.
- For the hook, the phrase “Oh-oh, like a melody that never fades,” is catchy, but we could add a simile that complements the ‘serenade’ line for a richer metaphor.

Overall, I believe "Chasing Echoes" has a solid foundation! A few refinements here and there will elevate the lyrics and ensure they connect powerfully with our listeners.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!

Best,
