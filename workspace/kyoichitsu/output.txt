**Review of Megan’s Draft: "Finding My Way"**

Overall, Megan’s draft embodies the themes of self-discovery and empowerment beautifully. The imagery is vivid, and the lyrical flow feels organic. Here are my thoughts on specific sections:

### **Strengths:**
1. **Imagery & Emotion:** The opening lines in **Verse 1** are striking. "In the mirror, I see a spark," captures a moment of introspection perfectly. It evokes a sense of hope and determination.
2. **Chorus Hook:** The chorus is both relatable and catchy, with lines like "Lost in the city lights, finding my way." This encapsulates the struggle and journey of self-discovery well, making it memorable and impactful.

### **Suggestions for Improvement:**
1. **Clarity in Metaphors:** In **Verse 1**, the phrase "chasing shadows" might benefit from more context to clarify its meaning. Perhaps adding a line that hints at what those shadows symbolize—fear, doubt, lost opportunities—could enhance the emotional depth.
   
2. **LINE 2 Adjustments for Flow:** The line "Every heartbeat's beating, lifting the load" in **Verse 2** could be streamlined for better flow. Consider revising it to “With every heartbeat, I’m lifting the load” to maintain rhythm without redundancy.

3. **Catchy Hook:** While the **Hook** is strong overall, try playing with the rhythm and cadence. Perhaps consider a variation in the phrasing: “Yeah, I rise up, breaking free, / Living my truth, it’s all about me.” This change softens the structure and makes it slightly more conversational.

### **Overall Impression:**
The draft is solid and resonates well with the target audience. Megan’s vision for an anthem of self-empowerment shines through. With slight adjustments for clarity and flow, I think it can elevate from great to outstanding.

Let’s keep the vibe flowing and make these tweaks to strengthen the narrative. I'm excited about how this track can shape up! 

Best,
