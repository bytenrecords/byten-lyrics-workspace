Subject: Feedback on Megan’s Draft - "Chasing Stars in the City"

Hi Team,

I've taken some time to review Megan's draft, and I must say there are several strong elements that resonate well. Here's my feedback:

### What's Great:
1. **Imagery**: The visual imagery throughout the lyrics is vivid and really draws the listener in—especially lines like “Lost in the alleyways, echoes of laughter” and “Streetlights like spotlights.” 
2. **Theme**: The overarching theme of chasing dreams and finding joy in the mundane is relatable and can appeal to a wide audience. It has a nice optimistic feel.

### Areas for Improvement:
1. **Flow**: In certain sections, the rhythm feels slightly uneven. For instance, the line “we shine from afar” could perhaps be rephrased to maintain the meter and flow better with the rest of the verse.
   - **Suggestion**: Change to “From afar, we light the way” or “Together we shine, lighting the way.”

2. **Chorus Repetition**: While the chorus is strong, consider enhancing its impact by varying the last two lines for the second chorus. This can keep it fresh for the listener.
   - **Suggestion**: Instead of repeating “we’re the bold and the proud,” perhaps we could say, “where dreams are allowed, we’ll stand out loud.”

3. **Hook Enhancement**: The imagery in the hook is lovely but could be punchier. Adding some internal rhyme or alliteration might enhance its catchiness. 
   - **Suggestion**: “So let’s run wild, let the music ignite, / With hearts unbound, we’ll paint the night bright.”

### Additional Tweaks:
- The outro could amplify the uplifting spirit. Consider making it a bit more dynamic, maybe by adding an imperative to evoke action. 
   - **Suggestion**: “Feel the beat, let the spirit ignite, / As we dance through the rhythms, we’ll chase the light.”

Overall, Megan’s draft has a fantastic base to build upon! I hope these suggestions help to enhance both the lyrical flow and emotional impact. Let’s keep the creative energy flowing, and I'm eager to see how this evolves!

Best,
