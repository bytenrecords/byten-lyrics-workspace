**Overall Thoughts:**  
Megan, I really love the vibe of "City Lights and Crown." The themes of self-discovery and resilience resonate well, especially connecting with the Gen Z audience. The imagery of city lights and the crown metaphor beautifully set up a narrative of seeking one's identity amidst chaos. Here are some strengths and suggestions for improvement:

**Strengths:**

1. **Imagery in Verse 1:**  
The opening lines immediately draw the listener in with vivid imagery. The phrase "my heart on my sleeve" is relatable and sets an emotional tone.

2. **Chorus Catchiness:**  
The repetition of "Can we just rewind" is catchy and enchanting. It has a nostalgic feel that invites listener participation.

3. **Hook Message:**  
The line "We’re brighter than the stars" is empowering and uplifting, wrapping the song in positivity.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1. **Verse 1 Tweaks:**
   - Consider switching "scrolling through memories" to "scrolling through pictures" to maintain the modern electronic theme.
   - Add an internal rhyme for a smoother flow, for example:  
     "Got my heart on my sleeve, bursting at the seams,  
      Caught in the web of facades, lost in my dreams."

2. **Chorus Engagement:**
   - For the chorus lines, think about emphasizing the emotional arc more. Try switching “wasn’t heavy” to “was light and free.” It adds a contrasting feel that emphasizes the weight listeners may relate to now.

3. **Outro Expansion:**  
   - The outro feels slightly abrupt. Consider adding a couple of lines that echo the spirit of rising and seeking, such as:  
     “So let’s break these walls, and chase the horizon,  
      With every heartbeat, a new dawn will summon.”

**Final Thoughts:**
This draft has great potential and just requires a bit of refining for flow and engagement. I can’t wait to hear how you incorporate these tweaks and take the lyrics to the next level! Let’s keep our ears open for fresh beats and melodies that complement this lyrical journey.

Best,
