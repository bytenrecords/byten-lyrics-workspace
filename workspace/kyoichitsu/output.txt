Subject: Feedback on Lyrics Draft

Hi Megan,

I've taken a look at your lyrics draft, and there are definitely some standout moments that resonate well! Here’s my detailed review along with some suggestions for improvement:

### Strengths:
1. **Imagery**: The opening lines create a vivid picture of the city and its lively atmosphere. Phrases like "neon lights" and "shadows dance" are engaging and immediately draw in listeners.
2. **Theme**: The themes of chasing dreams and living in the moment are relatable and compelling, making them great for engaging a wide audience.

### Suggestions for Improvement:
1. **Flow**: The rhythm can be enhanced in the verses for better lyrical flow. Consider adjusting the phrasing to create smoother transitions between lines. For example:
   - Original: "Lost in the rush, we find our place, hearts on fire, it’s a wild chase."
   - Suggested: "In the rush, we find our place, hearts ablaze—this wild chase."

2. **Repetition for Impact**: The chorus has a strong message, but adding a small repetition of a key phrase could emphasize the themes. Perhaps repeating “let's make it real” could heighten its impact.

3. **Rhyme Scheme**: To maintain a cohesive sound, look at the rhyme scheme throughout the verses. For instance, in the lines:
   - "Chasing dreams while the world sleeps, whispers of secrets the night keeps."
   You could modify the end words to match the earlier lines better while still conveying the same meaning.

### Overall Impression:
You've set a solid foundation with your lyrics, and there’s a lot of potential for making them even more engaging. I believe that with a few tweaks, we can enhance the lyrical flow and strengthen the emotional pull of the song.
