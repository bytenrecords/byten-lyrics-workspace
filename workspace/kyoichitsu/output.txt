Subject: Draft Review: "Radiant Youth"

Hi Megan,

I just went through your draft of "Radiant Youth," and I want to start by saying that it has a vibrant energy that perfectly captures the essence of youth and spontaneity! Here are my thoughts on what stands out and where we can enhance it a bit.

**What Sounds Great:**
1. **Imagery and Theme:** The imagery of city lights and neon glow evokes a strong sense of setting. It very much resonates with the alternative R&B vibe we're aiming for.
2. **Chorus Impact:** The repetition and rhythm in the chorus are powerful and catchy. It creates a solid hook that invites listeners to sing along.
3. **Fluidity of the Verses:** The conversion from personal experiences in the verses to the collective energy of the chorus effectively creates a connection with the audience.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
1. **Line Tightening:** In Verse 1, consider rephrasing "Let’s break the mold, let’s not repulse." to something more dynamic like "Let’s break the mold, let’s ignite." This could enhance the overall rhythm and punch of the line.
2. **Chorus Variation:** In the chorus, try to include a variation in the last line. Perhaps: "In this moment, we’re fearlessly whole." This creates a more definitive closure and can contrast well with "spark the night."
3. **Emotion in the Bridge:** The bridge is strong, but you might want to add some emotion. Instead of “Surrounded by stars and a world full of love,” you could say, “In the starlight, we’ll weave our love.” It elevates the romantic vibe while maintaining the theme of youth.

Overall, I think you're really close to something special here! These tweaks should help the lyrics flow even better and add a touch more engagement. Let’s sprinkle some magic on these words and make them shine! Looking forward to seeing where this vibe takes us.

Best,
