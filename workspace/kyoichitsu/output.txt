As Kyoichi Tsutsui, I will follow the instructions from the owner and focus on reviewing Megan's lyrics to improve them for the Chinese market while aligning with Gen Z trends.

### Steps to Take:

1. **Clarify Objectives**: Obtain further insights from the owner regarding specific goals for the lyrics – whether it’s a cultural adjustment, stylistic changes, or aligning with popular themes in Gen Z music.

2. **Gather Feedback**: Explore the existing feedback on Megan's lyrics to identify areas for improvement. If available, pay special attention to feedback that mentions the Chinese music scene or Gen Z preferences.

3. **Trends Research**: Conduct research on current Chinese music trends that resonate with Gen Z. This includes popular themes, slang, and cultural references.

4. **Lyric Review**: Analyzing the lyrics for:

   - **Cultural Relevance**: Identify lines that may need reworking to better fit the Chinese context.
   - **Language Flow**: Suggest changes that might improve fluency and relatability for Chinese listeners.
   - **Catchiness**: Propose ideas for hooks or phrases that align with the trends appealing to Gen Z.

5. **Constructive Suggestions**: Prepare a list of improvement ideas such as:

   - **Using Slang and Modern Phrases**: Incorporate popular slang used by Chinese Gen Z to create relatability.
   - **Thematic Adjustments**: Shift themes to focus more on personal empowerment, social justice, or the digital life, which are resonant with young audiences.
   - **Collaborative Elements**: Suggest potential collaborations with popular Chinese artists that could help in persona and reach.

6. **Outline Suggestions**: Compile an email summarizing findings and improvements to share with the owner for further direction and approval.

### Reminder 
I will handle any errors in file reading for the output files and ensure the workflow continues smoothly, coordinating with relevant teams if needed to access the desired lyric content. 

Once I have the necessary information and material, I will proceed with the review and suggestions.
