**Status Update:**

Kyoichitsu has sent an email to the owner requesting specific instructions for reviewing Megan's lyrics. Once the owner responds with details about themes, style, or any specific improvement directions for the lyrics, Kyoichitsu will proceed to review and formulate improvement ideas.

Simultaneously, Megan Li has also reached out to the owner for instructions on creating new song lyrics. She is awaiting feedback on the title, style of music, and themes before she begins drafting.

**Next Steps:**
- Await the owner's response to both Kyoichitsu and Megan's inquiries.
- Upon receiving guidance, Kyoichitsu will review the lyrics and provide suggestions, while Megan will draft new lyrics based on the given direction.
