Subject: Review of "Unbound Echoes" Draft

Hi Megan,

I’ve taken some time to review your draft for "Unbound Echoes," and I must say, there's a lot of great energy and emotion here! 

**What Sounds Great:**
- **Chorus:** The repetitiveness of "Hey, I’m unbound," is catchy and feels empowering. It captures the spirit of liberation and self-discovery effectively.
- **Imagery:** Your use of imagery in "colors that float in the air" and "flipping the pages, rewriting fate" is vivid and engaging, drawing the listener into a journey. 

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
1. **Verse 1:** 
   - Consider tweaking “Searching for pieces I can’t find” to “Searching for the pieces I’ve left behind.” This adds a touch of nostalgia and a stronger sense of personal journey.
   
2. **Hook:** 
   - The line "Dare to be free, just like the stars," is solid, but perhaps revising it to "Dare to shine bright, just like the stars," would enhance its imagery and align it with the theme of individuality.

3. **Verse 2:** 
   - The line "Shining through every twist of hate" could be made more impactful with, "Shining bright despite the hate." This slight adjustment keeps the rhythm and reinforces resilience.

4. **Flow Enhancement:** 
   - To maintain a smoother flow through the verses, consider adding a rhythmic connector in places, like “And as we move” before “Together we’ll light up the stark," to create a more seamless transition.

Overall, these are minor tweaks, and I believe they could help elevate the lyrics further. I appreciate the vibrant themes and energetic vibe you've put into this. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!

Best,
