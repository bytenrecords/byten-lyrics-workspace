**Review of "Chasing Neon Dreams" Draft**

Hi Megan,

Thank you for sending over your draft for "Chasing Neon Dreams." I appreciate the vibrant energy and the way you capture the essence of city life. Here’s my feedback on various sections and some suggestions for enhancement:

### **Overall Impression**
The concept is engaging and fits well within the alternative R&B, synth-pop vibe we're aiming for. It has a youthful exuberance that will resonate with our target audience.

### **[Verse 1]**
**Current Lyrics:**  
Chasing dreams through neon lights,  
We’ll paint the night with our fire,  
Heartbeats sync with city vibes,  
Let’s write our story, take it higher.

**Feedback:**  
These lines set the scene beautifully. The imagery is vivid, which is great.

**Suggestions:**  
- Consider making "city vibes" more playful or poetic to enhance the imagery. Perhaps something like "city’s pulse" or "pulsing city sound" could fit well.
  
### **[Chorus]**
**Current Lyrics:**  
When the stars come out to play,  
We’ll dance till the break of day,  
In this moment, it feels right,  
Together we’ll set the night alight!

**Feedback:**  
I love the uplifting tone of the chorus. It captures the joy of living in the moment.

**Suggestions:**  
- A minor tweak in the second line might strengthen the flow. Perhaps “We’ll dance 'til dawn’s first light” would create a smoother rhythm.

### **[Hook]**
**Current Lyrics:**  
Oh-oh-oh, let’s fly away,  
In this city, we’ll drift and sway,  
Oh-oh-oh, hearts in the sky,  
With every heartbeat, we come alive!

**Feedback:**  
This section is catchy and fun! The repetition works well.

**Suggestions:**  
- In the second line, you might streamline the phrasing to "drift and sway through the night" for added clarity and rhythm.

### **[Verse 2]**
**Current Lyrics:**  
Lost in rhythm, we lose our way,  
But in the chaos, we find our sway,  
Electric vibes, we’ll share the thrill,  
Living for now, can’t get our fill.

**Feedback:**  
The theme of losing oneself in music is relatable and captivating.

**Suggestions:**  
- Consider rephrasing the third line to something like “Electric pulses give us a thrill” for a more dynamic feel.

### **[Outro]**
**Current Lyrics:**  
(Instrumental fade out with playful chants)  
Let’s run away... let’s run away...

**Feedback:**  
The outro gives a sense of conclusion while leaving an open invitation to adventure.

**Suggestions:**  
- Perhaps you can add a line before the fade-out, something like, “Into the night, let’s make our way...” to parallel with the earlier themes.

### **Final Thoughts**
Great job overall! The lyrics have a strong foundation, and with these minor tweaks, they can flow even more smoothly while amplifying engagement. Let’s continue refining this piece and see where it takes us!

Looking forward to your thoughts!

Best,
