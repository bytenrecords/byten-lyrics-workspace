Subject: Feedback on Megan’s Draft

Hi Megan,

I've taken a look at your draft and wanted to share my thoughts. Overall, you've got some fantastic ideas that really capture the essence of the emotions we want to convey. Here are my notes:

**What Works:**
1. **Imagery**: The imagery you’ve used in the lyrics is vivid and relatable. Lines like "I find peace in your silence" really stand out and evoke a strong visual and emotional response.
2. **Theme**: The theme of defiance amidst chaos resonates well, especially with the current zeitgeist.

**Suggested Tweaks:**
1. Consider smoothening the flow in the first verse. Perhaps rephrase "I find peace in your silence" to "In your silence, I find my peace." This shifts the rhythm and makes it slightly more lyrical.
2. For the phrase "Storms may rage, we’ll stand our ground," try to introduce a bit of internal rhyme, like “Storms may rage, but we’ll hold our ground.” This can enhance the musicality.

**Overall Flow**: The verses have a solid structure, but we might benefit from adding a pre-chorus that heightens anticipation. If you have any ideas or lines that feel like they’d lead into a chorus, let’s explore that!

I’m looking forward to seeing how we can refine these lyrics together to make them even more engaging. Let me know your thoughts on these suggestions!

Best,
