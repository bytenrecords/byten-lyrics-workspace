It seems there's an issue with reading the drafts due to encoding errors. To proceed, I suggest the following steps:

1. **Check the File Format**: Ensure that the files are saved in a standard encoding format like UTF-8, which usually helps in preventing these character mapping issues.

2. **Use a Text Editor**: Open the files in a text editor that supports various encoding formats (like Notepad++ or Sublime Text) to examine the content. This can help identify if there's any corruption in the text.

3. **Share the Content**: If the issues persist, you could copy and paste the content directly into our conversation, and I can provide feedback from there.

Once I have access to the content, I can thoroughly review Meganâ€™s draft, noting the strengths while also identifying areas for improvement. Looking forward to your next steps!
