Subject: Feedback on "Electric Love" Draft

Hi Megan,

I’ve gone through the draft for “Electric Love,” and I must say, it has a captivating essence! Here are some thoughts on the lyrics:

**What Works:**
1. **Imagery:** The opening lines in the first verse set a beautifully vivid scene with the midnight glow and the chase of stars. It immediately transports the listener into a dreamy atmosphere.
2. **Emotional Resonance:** The concepts of healing scars and redefining love are powerful and relatable. It gives the song depth, allowing the audience to connect on a personal level.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Flow and Consistency:** In the first verse, the phrase "In the midnight glow" is lovely, but consider making it more active. Perhaps starting with something like "Underneath the midnight glow" could enhance the flow and imagery.
2. **Repetition in Chorus:** The chorus is catchy, but repeating "take my hand" might make it feel like it's losing some variety. Maybe we could vary that line in the second iteration to keep it fresh—perhaps "Hold me tight, let’s soar away" could work?
3. **Lyric Tightening:** The hook has great energy but might benefit from a slight tweak to create a more striking ending. Instead of "I could never say goodbye," you might try "With you, I’ll never let go." It maintains the sentiment while providing a stronger statement.

These are minor tweaks that can elevate what is already a strong foundation. I’m excited about where we can take this! Let’s keep the creative energy flowing, and I believe we’ll create something truly magical together.

Looking forward to your thoughts!

Best,
