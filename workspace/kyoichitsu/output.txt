**Review of Megan’s Draft for "Neon Nights"**

**Overall Impression:**
Megan, you've done an impressive job with "Neon Nights"! The imagery is vibrant and sets a strong atmosphere that fits the alternative R&B vibe you're aiming for. The use of sensory language draws the listener in beautifully. 

**What Sounds Great:**
1. **Verse 1:** The lines "When the city lights flicker, we dance in the rain" have a captivating visual element. The pairing of imagery and emotion here works excellently; it invites the audience into the scene.
2. **Chorus:** The repeated use of "we're electric" effectively emphasizes connection and intimacy, perfect for the theme of love and unity. 
3. **Hook:** The phrase "Neon nights, we’ll light the way" has a strong melodic potential and reinforces the central theme, making it memorable.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Dynamics in Verse 2:** While the imagery is lovely, consider adding a more dynamic shift to contrast with verse 1. Maybe introduce a little conflict or tension—something to hint at challenges that deepen the narrative of your relationship.
  
   *Suggestion: "In whispers of the dark, secrets yet untold,  
   With you beside me, the warmth pushes cold."*

2. **Chorus Flow:** The chorus feels repetitive without much variation between its occurrences. You might consider adding a slight twist in the second iteration to keep listeners engaged.

   *Suggestion: "Oh, we’re electric, feel the heat,  
   This love, ignited, setting us free."*

3. **Language Integration:** You mentioned integrating Chinese or Japanese. Perhaps try using a line in either language in the chorus or hook to enhance cross-cultural appeal and uniqueness. 

   *Suggestion: "在这个夜晚 (In this night), we’ll let love grow."*

**Conclusion:**
Your draft has a strong foundation that captures the essence of what we want to convey. With just a few tweaks to flow and structure, it could become an exceptional track. I look forward to seeing how it evolves and am excited about the possibility of incorporating different languages! 

Feel free to send over any revisions or additional ideas. Keep up the fantastic work! 

Best,
