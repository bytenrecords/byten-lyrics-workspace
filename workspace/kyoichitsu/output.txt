Subject: Review of "Midnight Parade" Draft

Hi Megan,

I’ve taken a careful look at your draft for "Midnight Parade," and I have to say, there are some fantastic elements already in place! Let me break down my thoughts along with a few suggestions to enhance the overall flow and engagement of the lyrics.

**Highlights:**
- The imagery in the first verse is striking; "the lights fade" and "rooftop high" really sets a vibrant scene.
- The chorus has a catchy rhythmic quality that captures the essence of celebration—great job!

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1. **Verse 1:**
   - Consider tightening the second line for rhythm:  
     *Original: “We find solace in the midnight parade.”*  
     *Suggested: “We find our solace in the midnight parade.”*  
     This small tweak emphasizes the personal connection to the experience.

2. **Chorus:**
   - The line “In this moment, we’ll let it flow” feels a bit straightforward.  
     *Suggested: “In this moment, let the euphoria flow.”*  
     This change maintains the conversational tone but introduces a more vivid emotional response.

3. **Verse 2:**
   - The second line flows nicely, but it could benefit from a bit more movement:  
     *Original: “We dance in circles, you and I.”*  
     *Suggested: “We whirl and twirl beneath the sky.”*  
     This variation adds more kinetic energy, enhancing the dance theme.

4. **Hook:**
   - The sentiment is powerful, but I recommend a little more specificity:  
     *Original: “Together we're unstoppable tonight.”*  
     *Suggested: “With hearts aglow, we’re unstoppable tonight.”*  
     This ties back to the glowing imagery from the chorus and adds depth.

Overall, I think your lyrics have a great foundation, and with these small tweaks, we can enhance the flow and make the emotional punch even stronger. I appreciate the vibrant energy you’ve brought to this piece, and I’m excited to see how we can flesh it out even more.

Let me know your thoughts!

Best,
