Subject: Feedback on Megan's Draft

Hi Megan,

I've taken a careful look at your draft, and I have to say, there’s a lot of engaging content here! The imagery in your lyrics is vivid, and it really sets the mood for what we’re trying to capture. Here’s a breakdown of what stands out and where I believe we could make some tweaks for an even stronger impact:

### Strengths:
- **Imagery**: Phrases like "neon glow" and "shadows dance" effectively create a visual scene that draws the listener in.
- **Rhythm**: The overall rhythm of the lines flows nicely, particularly in the chorus where the repetition enhances the vibe.

### Suggestions for Improvement:
1. **Verse 1 Line 3**: The line "Whispers of dreams, like waves we ride," is lovely but could be tightened up. Perhaps saying "Dreams whisper like waves we ride" might enhance the flow.
   
2. **Chorus Line 2**: The phrase "Chasing stars, we’ll never resist," is compelling, but "we won't resist" might feel a bit more grounded than "we'll never resist," which is a bit lofty. 

3. **Cultural Blend**: I appreciate your openness to blending cultures, but we might want a clear motif that unifies these elements. Maybe consider integrating a couple of lines or motifs from another language directly within the verses to enhance cultural depth.

Overall, your draft already has a solid foundation. Small adjustments like these can really spice it up and make the lyrics feel more engaging and relatable to the audience we're targeting. Let me know what you think of these suggestions!

Best,
