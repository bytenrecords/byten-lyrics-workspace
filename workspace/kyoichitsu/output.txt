It seems there are errors with reading the files due to encoding issues. I'll work on understanding how best to approach this by addressing both outputs and providing feedback as needed. 

Let's focus first on Megan's draft. Since I can't access the text directly, I'll outline a general approach for reviewing and refining song lyrics, which could be of help once we have a properly formatted version to work with.

### General Review Strategy:

1. **Identify Strengths**:
   - Look for lines or phrases that resonate emotionally.
   - Note catchy hooks or powerful imagery that stand out.

2. **Suggest Improvements**:
   - **Flow**: Ensure that the lyrics have a natural rhythm. Read them aloud to catch any awkward phrases or syllables that disrupt the beat.
   - **Repetition**: Evaluate if certain lines or themes need reinforcing for impact or if theyâ€™re overdone.
   - **Imagery**: Suggest more vivid or relatable imagery where necessary to create stronger visual connections.

3. **Tweaks for Engagement**:
   - Consider adding some unexpected word choices or metaphors that can surprise the listener.
   - Propose slight adjustments to line breaks or structure that might enhance emotional impact.

### Example Suggestions:
- Change a predictable rhyming couplet to something unique.
- Introduce a recurring motif that ties the verses together seamlessly.
- Use alliteration or assonance to create a more musical flow.

Once I can access or decode Megan's draft, these suggestions can be tailored specifically to her lyrics. For now, it might be useful to try opening the files in an editor that supports different encodings or converting them to a UTF-8 format to allow for proper reading. Can I assist you with anything else in the meantime?
