Subject: Feedback on Megan’s Draft

Hi Megan,

I've taken a thorough look at your draft and I must say, you've laid a solid foundation here. There are several parts that shine brightly, and I believe with a few tweaks, we can elevate the overall impact.

### Highlights:
- **Imagery**: Your use of imagery to convey emotion is compelling, especially in the lines about searching for light and igniting passion. This resonates well with our target audience.
- **Structure**: The overall flow of the verses is engaging and keeps the listener's attention.

### Areas for Improvement:
1. **Verse Clarity**: Some lines feel a bit congested. For instance, the line “Chasing dreams on a midnight drive” could be broken into two shorter lines to enhance lyrical rhythm and clarity.
2. **Emotional Depth**: Adding a bit more vulnerability could strengthen the connection with listeners. Consider incorporating personal touches or questions that provoke thought—something that invites the audience to reflect.
3. **Rhyme Scheme**: There’s a slight inconsistency in the rhyme scheme towards the end. Ensuring that all lines have a cohesive rhyme can make the lyrics feel more polished.

### Suggested Tweaks:
- Change “With every heartbeat, we’ll rise, we’ll ignite” to “Each heartbeat whispers, rise up, ignite.” This keeps the meaning intact while simplifying the rhythm.
- For the line “Together we’ll find what it means to be alive”, consider incorporating a metaphor for life—like “Together we’ll navigate these tides to feel alive” which adds a sense of journey and exploration.

Let’s make these small adjustments to enhance the lyrical flow and deepen the emotional connection. I’m looking forward to seeing it evolve!

Best,
