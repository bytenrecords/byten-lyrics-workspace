Kyoichi, it looks like you've made solid improvements to Megan's original lyrics for "Night Sky Dreams." Here are the steps I suggest to proceed from here:

1. **Email Megan:** 
   Compose an email to Megan sharing the improved lyrics and the constructive feedback that highlights the changes. 

2. **Invite Feedback:** 
   Encourage Megan to provide her thoughts on the suggestions and whether they align with her artistic vision. This will foster collaboration and ensure she feels involved in the creative process.

3. **Discuss Trends:**
   Be prepared to discuss current trends among Gen Z, particularly regarding themes of love, nature, and emotional depth in music that resonate with them. Offer insights on how these trends can be integrated into Megan's lyrics.

4. **Plan a Follow-Up:**
   Consider scheduling a follow-up session with Megan to review her feedback and discuss any further revisions. This will help you both solidify the direction of the song.

5. **Prepare for Production:**
   If Megan is happy with the changes, start planning for the arrangement or production aspect of the song while keeping her stylistic preferences in mind.
