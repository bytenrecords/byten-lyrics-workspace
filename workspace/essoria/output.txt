**Title: "Chasing Fireflies"**  

**[Intro] [Instrumental]**  
*(Soft guitar strumming with gentle percussion)*  

**[Verse 1]**  
In the twilight glow, we run so free,  
Laughing till we can't, just you and me.  
Whispers in the breeze, secrets in our eyes,  
Every little moment feels like a surprise.  

**[Chorus]**  
Chasing fireflies, lighting up the night,  
With hearts wide open, everything feels right.  
Letâ€™s dance in the shadows, sing under the stars,  
In this little dream, we know just who we are.  

**[Verse 2]**  
Every shared smile, a spark to ignite,  
Your laughter's like magic; it makes everything bright.  
With dreams in our pockets, weâ€™ll make our own way,  
Together, weâ€™ll paint the colors of the day.  

**[Chorus]**  
Chasing fireflies, lighting up the night,  
With hearts wide open, everything feels right.  
Letâ€™s dance in the shadows, sing under the stars,  
In this little dream, we know just who we are.  

**[Hook]**  
Oh-oh, weâ€™re running wild,  
Just a couple of kids, with the world as our style.  
Oh-oh, let the night ignite,  
With every moment captured, letâ€™s hold on tight.  

**[Outro] [Instrumental]**  
*(Fading out with soft guitar and soothing melodies)*
