**Title:** Chasing Neon Dreams

**[Intro]**  
(Upbeat synths and groovy bass to set the playful mood)

**[Verse 1]**  
Chasing dreams through neon lights,  
We’ll paint the night with our fire,  
Heartbeats sync with city vibes,  
Let’s write our story, take it higher.  

**[Chorus]**  
When the stars come out to play,  
We’ll dance till the break of day,  
In this moment, it feels right,  
Together we’ll set the night alight!  

**[Hook]**  
Oh-oh-oh, let’s fly away,  
In this city, we’ll drift and sway,  
Oh-oh-oh, hearts in the sky,  
With every heartbeat, we come alive!  

**[Verse 2]**  
Lost in rhythm, we lose our way,  
But in the chaos, we find our sway,  
Electric vibes, we’ll share the thrill,  
Living for now, can’t get our fill.  

**[Chorus]**  
When the stars come out to play,  
We’ll dance till the break of day,  
In this moment, it feels right,  
Together we’ll set the night alight!  

**[Outro]**  
(Instrumental fade out with playful chants)  
Let’s run away... let’s run away...

Chasing dreams in neon hues,  
Igniting nights, it’s me and you,  
Heartbeat syncing with city’s pulse,  
Our adventure’s written, no need to coax.
