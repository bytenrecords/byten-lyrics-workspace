Subject: Fresh Collaboration on Our New Track!

Hey team!

Thank you all for your contributions so far! I’ve taken a look at the initial lyric ideas, and while we’ve encountered some technical hiccups with the files, I believe we can still create something spectacular together.

**Title: "Light in the Echoes"**

Here’s the structure I propose based on Stan's verse and incorporating the essence of both Megan's and Kyoichitsu's styles, once we can access those files:

**[Intro]**  
(Soft instrumental intro with a gradual build-up, setting a dreamy yet vibrant tone)

**[Verse 1]**  
"In a world of echoes, I’m searching for the light,  
With every heartbeat, we’ll rise, we’ll ignite.  
Chasing dreams on a midnight drive,  
Together we’ll find what it means to be alive."

**[Chorus]**  
"We’ll dance in the shadows, paint our own skies,  
Break through the noise, hear the truth in our cries.  
With every heartbeat, we’re rewriting the song,  
In this fleeting moment, together we belong."

**[Verse 2]**  
(Here, we can introduce a new idea or narrative, weaving in elements from the other contributors once we access the files)

**[Chorus]**  
(Repeat with harmonies to enhance the emotional impact)

**Style Suggestions:**  
1. Alternative R&B  
2. Soulful Pop  
3. Electro-Pop  
4. Indie R&B  
5. Dream Pop

Let’s keep the vibe fresh, catchy, and smooth, focusing on heartfelt storytelling and emotional resonance. I can’t wait to see how we can refine and perfect this together!

Best,  
Isadora Lee
