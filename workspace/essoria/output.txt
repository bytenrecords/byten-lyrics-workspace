**[Verse 1]:**  
Walking through the city lights, dreams in our hands,  
Chasing fleeting moments lost in digital strands.  
Heartbeats synced like the rhythm of the night,  
Let’s break down the walls, step into the light.

---

**[Chorus]:**  
We’re the echoes of a new generation,  
No fear, just hope, pure motivation.  
Gonna ride this wave, feel the energy rise,  
Together we’ll soar, like stars in the skies.

**[Hook]:**  
Oh-oh, we’re dancing on the edge,  
In the now, let’s make a pledge.  
Shining brighter, never looking back,  
With our dreams alive, we’ll illuminate the track.

**[Verse 2]:**  
Masked attitudes, scrolling through the noise,  
But in this moment, we’re simply kids with poise.  
Behind our screens, with hearts aligned,  
Laughing with our souls, leaving fear behind.

**[Chorus]:**  
We’re the echoes of a new generation,  
No fear, just hope, pure motivation.  
Gonna ride this wave, feel the energy rise,  
Together we’ll soar, like stars in the skies.

---

**[Bridge]:**  
In the quiet nights, when the world feels still,  
We find strength in dreams, powered by our will.  
Let’s rise up together, let our voices be heard,  
Writing our own story, one that’s truly stirred.

---

**[Final Chorus]:**  
We’re the echoes of a new generation,  
No fear, just hope, pure motivation.  
Gonna ride this wave, feel the energy rise,  
As we light the way, we’re the stars in the skies.
