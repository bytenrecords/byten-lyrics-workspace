**Title:** Night Sky Dreams

**Improved Lyrics:**

[intro] [instrumental]  

[verse]  
Under the night sky, wandering free,  
Stars like diamonds, casting their glee.  
Rustling leaves sing, secrets unfold,  
The cool breeze whispers, stories retold.  

[chorus]  
Hold me close, as we sway in the dark,  
Together we'll shine, igniting our spark.  
With every heartbeat, our souls intertwine,  
In this night sky, forever you'll be mine.  

[bridge]  
Moonlight kisses, a gentle embrace,  
Lost in the magic of this sacred space.  
Time stands still, as we tailor our dreams,  
In the arms of the cosmos, nothing's as it seems.  

[chorus]  
Hold me close, as we sway in the dark,  
Transformation awaits, igniting our spark.  
With every heartbeat, the past won't confine,  
In this night sky, forever you'll be mine.  

[outro]  
As the night fades, our hearts will align,  
Under the stars, love's infinite sign.  
[instrumental]
