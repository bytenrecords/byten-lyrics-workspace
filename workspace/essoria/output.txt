**Refined Lyrics Draft**

**Title: "City Pulse"**

**[Intro]**  
In the neon glow, where dreams ignite,  
Together we chase the stars tonight.

**[Verse 1]**  
In the neon glow, where shadows dance,  
We find our truth in a restless trance.  
Dreams whisper softly, waves we ride,  
With every heartbeat, the world’s on our side.

**[Chorus]**  
Feel the rhythm of the city pulse,  
Chasing stars, we won’t resist.  
Echoes of youth in the night we trust,  
Together we rise, it’s a must.

**[Verse 2]**  
Under moonlit skies, we break the mold,  
With each step forward, our stories unfold.  
Blending cultures, we’re a tapestry,  
Voices united in sweet harmony.

**[Chorus]**  
Feel the rhythm of the city pulse,  
Chasing stars, we won’t resist.  
Echoes of youth in the night we trust,  
Together we rise, it’s a must.

**[Bridge]**  
(Insert a line/motif in Mandarin or Japanese here for cultural depth, e.g., “星空の下で” - "Under the starry sky.")  
With every heartbeat, we'll paint the night,  
In this vibrant world, our hopes take flight.

**[Outro]**  
So let the music take you away,  
In the city’s arms, we long to stay.
