(A soft electric piano intro that builds into a rhythmic beat)

**[Verse 1]**  
"Lost in the echoes of my mind,  
Searching for pieces I can’t find.  
In a world that’s buzzing loud,  
I’ll dance through the noise, unbowed."

"Hey, I’m unbound,  
Breaking the chains I used to wear.  
Finding my sound,  
In colors that float in the air."

"Let’s celebrate, we’re alive,  
In this moment, we all thrive.  
Dare to be free, just like the stars,  
We’re writing our own memoirs."

"Flipping the pages, rewriting fate,  
Shining through every twist of hate.  
Our essence sparkles in the dark,  
Together we’ll light up the stark."

**[Chorus]**  
"Hey, I’m unbound,  
Breaking the chains I used to wear.  
Finding my sound,  
In colors that float in the air."

**[Intro] [Instrumental]**  
(A gentle electric piano introduces the vibe, gradually blending in rhythmic layers)

**[Verse 1]**  
"Lost in the echoes of my mind,  
Chasing the fragments left behind.  
In a world that hums and shouts,  
I’ll weave through the noise, no doubts."

"Hey, I’m unbound,  
Shattering illusions draped in despair.  
Hearing my sound,  
In colors that dance through the air."

"Let’s rejoice, for we are alive,  
In this moment, we truly thrive.  
Dare to shine, just like the stars,  
We’re crafting our own memoirs."

"Turning the pages, rewriting fate,  
Illuminating paths through love and hate.  
Our essence flickers in the night,  
Together, we’ll ignite the light."

"Hey, I’m unbound,  
Shattering illusions draped in despair.  
Hearing my sound,  
In colors that dance through the air."
