### Improved Lyrics for "Echoes in the Dark"

[**intro**] [instrumental] 

[**verse 1**]  
In neon ghosts that flicker in the fog,  
Running wild through the star-studded smog,  
Whispers echo, secrets intertwine,  
In a world where our dreams collide.  

[**chorus**]  
We are the dreamers dancing in the dark,  
Chasing the echoes, igniting the spark,  
With every heartbeat, we’ll leave our mark,  
Together we soar, igniting the night’s heart.  

[**verse 2**]  
Lost in moments, timeless souls entwined,  
Painting the heavens with the tales we've defined,  
In every heartbeat, in every sigh,  
We’ll write our anthem while the stars align.  

[**chorus**]  
We are the dreamers dancing in the dark,  
Chasing the echoes, igniting the spark,  
With every heartbeat, we’ll leave our mark,  
Together we soar, igniting the night’s heart.  

[**bridge**]  
Stars above, guiding our way anew,  
Doubts may whisper, but we'll break through,  
In this crescendo, our fears will fade,  
Our melody rises, no longer afraid.  

[**chorus**]  
We are the dreamers dancing in the dark,  
Chasing the echoes, igniting the spark,  
With every heartbeat, we’ll leave our mark,  
Together we soar, igniting the night’s heart.  

[**outro**]  
Tonight, we rise, a final refrain,  
Our dreams forever, a glorious gain. [instrumental]
