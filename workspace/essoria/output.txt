Neon lights flicker, casting midnight schemes.  
Lost in a world that moves so fast,  
Our connection, oh, it's built to last."

A spark in your eyes, I stop and stare.  
With every heartbeat, we’re spinning around,  
In this tangled web, our love is found."

Waves of emotion in the choices we made.  
Lost in the magic of this urban night,  
Hand in hand, we’ll take flight."

"Under the stars, just you and me,  
Dancing to the rhythm of our destiny.  
In this moment, we’re wild and free,  
Let’s paint the sky with our melody."
