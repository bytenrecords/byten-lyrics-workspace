It seems we are experiencing encoding errors with the lyric drafts from Megan and Kyoichitsu. To move forward and refine the lyrics, I will need access to the content in a readable format. Here’s what I propose:

1. **Text Editors**: If you have access to a text editor like Notepad++ or Sublime Text, please try opening the files there. These editors are better at handling encoding issues and can display the content correctly.

2. **Copy and Paste**: If the above doesn’t work, please copy the content directly from the files and paste it here. Once I can see the lyrics, I will refine them as you requested.

3. **New Drafts**: If you're unable to recover the content, perhaps Megan can resend the lyrics through email, or you could provide a brief summary of the themes and mood she was aiming for.

Once I have the correct content, I’ll craft the final version with care, selecting suitable music styles, a catchy title, and ensuring everything maintains a fresh and smooth vibe. Thank you! Looking forward to your next steps!
