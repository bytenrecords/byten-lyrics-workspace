**Revised Version of Megan’s Lyrics: "Echoes of Tomorrow"**

[intro] [instrumental]  
In the heart where dreams collide,  
Whispers of hopes, we can't hide.  
With every step, a fire ignites,  
Chasing the stars on endless nights.  

[verse]  
Scrolling through memories,  
Pictures frozen in time.  
Every laugh and every tear,  
Building a journey, a love sublime.  

[chorus]  
We'll rise like the sun, never retreat,  
With the rhythm of life beneath our feet.  
In this moment, we are alive,  
Chasing the echoes, we will thrive.  

[bridge]  
Through storms and shadows, we’ll find our way,  
Together forever, come what may.  
Links to the past, futures in our grasp,  
In this timeless dance, we will last.  

[outro]  
As the night fades into day,  
We'll find our path, come what may.  
With the echoes of tomorrow in our heart,  
This journey together will never part.  

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
1. Incorporate a more dynamic structure by adding a pre-chorus to build emotion before the main chorus.
2. Add a metaphor or imagery throughout the lyrics to enhance emotional depth (e.g., refer to nature more explicitly).
3. Consider introducing a contrasting section to highlight a moment of doubt or fear, adding more texture to the narrative.

**Final Enhancements:**
- Integrating more varied vocabulary and imagery can elevate the emotional impact.  
- Consider adding a call-and-response element in the chorus to create an interactive feel for live performances.

**Music Styles:**
- Alternative RnB, Indie Pop, Dream Pop, Synthwave, Electropop

**Title:** 
"Echoes of Tomorrow"
