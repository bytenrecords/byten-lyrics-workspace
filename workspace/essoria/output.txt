**Title:** "Chasing Colors"

**Intro:**  
(Whimsical instrumentals, gentle piano with a subtle synth)  
"Hey there, feeling lost in a wild, wild world..."

**Verse 1:**  
"Lost in the city lights, chasing dreams we can't define,  
Falling stars whisper secrets, they're yours and they're mine.  
With every heartbreak echo, we rise and redefine,  
In this world of chaos, your heartbeat feels like a sign."

**Chorus:**  
"Letâ€™s paint our hearts in colors bright,  
Dancing through the dark, making shadows light.  
With every step, weâ€™re breaking free,  
In this symphony of you and me."

**Hook:**  
"Chasing, chasing, chasing colors,  
Together weâ€™ll go, just like no others.  
Our spirits lift, let the music guide,  
In this crazy ride, side by side!"
