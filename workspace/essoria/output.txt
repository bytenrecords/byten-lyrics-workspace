**Title: "Chasing Stars"**

**[intro]**  
(Instrumental: Soft synths and gentle beats build up)

**[verse 1]**  
In the city lights, we chase our dreams,  
Through the highs and lows, breaking at the seams.  
Heartbeat syncs with the rhythm of the night,  
We’re the stars, shining, ready to ignite.

**[chorus]**  
So let’s run wild, let’s lose control,  
Dive into the magic, let the music take hold.  
Together we rise, in this beautiful haze,  
In the rush of the moment, we’ll dance through the maze.

**[hook]**  
We’re living for today, let the doubts fade away,  
Feel the pulse of the night, as we laugh and we sway.  
Chasing stars, we’ll light the way,  
Making memories that forever stay.

**[verse 2]**  
With every step, we’re breaking the mold,  
Writing our stories, fearless and bold.  
Coloring the streets with our vibrant theme,  
In this life, we’re painting our dream.

**[chorus]**  
So let’s run wild, let’s lose control,  
Dive into the magic, let the music take hold.  
Together we rise, in this beautiful haze,  
In the rush of the moment, we’ll dance through the maze.
