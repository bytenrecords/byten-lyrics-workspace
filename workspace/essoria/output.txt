**[Verse 1]**  
Beneath the city's glow, we're chasing fire,  
With every beat, weâ€™re climbing higher.  
Stories written, a tale we weave,  
In the shadows, our hearts believe.

Under moonlit skies, we sway and play.  
Echoes of dreams, where moments collide,  
In this fleeting hour, let the world slide."  

**[Verse 2]**  
Feel the magic swirling through the night,  
With every step we take, our souls take flight.  
Hold me close, letâ€™s slip through the rush,  
In this shared dream, itâ€™s just us.

Under moonlit skies, we sway and play.  
Echoes of dreams, where moments collide,  
In this fleeting hour, let the world slide."

Weâ€™ll make memories, forevermore."
