**Title:** "Midnight Parade"

**Refined Lyric Version:**

*[Intro]*  
*(Uplifting synths with a catchy beat)*

*Verse 1:*  
In this city where the lights fade,  
We find our solace in the midnight parade.  
Chasing dreams from rooftop high,  
We’re the vibrant stars, soaring the sky.

*Chorus:*  
Hands up high, feel our glow,  
In this moment, let the good times flow.  
Let the rhythm guide our way,  
Into a world where we’re free to sway.

*Verse 2:*  
Underneath the neon hues,  
We dance in circles, just us two.  
Feel that magic, breathe it deep,  
With every heartbeat, our spirits leap.

*Chorus:*  
Hands up high, feel our glow,  
In this moment, let the good times flow.  
Let the rhythm carry us away,  
Into a world where we’re free to sway.

*Hook:*  
Oh-oh, let’s ride this wave,  
With every step, we’re bold and brave.  
Together we're unstoppable tonight,  
In this midnight parade, we shine so bright.

*[Outro]*  
*(Fade out with shimmering synths and echoing vocals)*
