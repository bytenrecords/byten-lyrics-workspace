**Title**: Echoes of Yesterday  

**[Intro] [Instrumental]**  

**[Verse 1]**  
When the sun sets low, shadows start to sway,  
Whispers of the night guide us to stay.  
In a world so vivid, colors blend and play,  
Chasing dreams together—come, let’s find our way.  

**[Chorus]**  
Oh, we're the story still unfolding,  
Hearts ablaze, forever holding.  
With every beat, our hearts are molding,  
In this moment, love's exploding.  

**[Hook]**  
Let’s dance through the echoes of yesterday,  
With every step, we break away.  

**[Verse 2]**  
Underneath the stars, our secrets take flight,  
We’ll paint our tomorrows in the velvet night.  
With your hand in mine, we will touch the sky,  
Boundless like the ocean, where dreams don’t die.  

**[Chorus]**  
Oh, we're the story still unfolding,  
Hearts ablaze, forever holding.  
With every beat, our hearts are molding,  
In this moment, love's exploding.  

**[Bridge]**  
So let the music take its toll,  
Feel the rhythm deep in your soul.  
We’re the fire, we own the night,  
Together we ignite the light.
