**Refined Lyrics:**

**Title:** Radiant Youth  

**[Intro] [Instrumental]**  

**[Verse 1]:**  
In the city lights, we shine,  
Chasing dreams, a steady climb,  
Heartbeats sync to rhythm's flow,  
Letâ€™s break the mold, letâ€™s let it show.  

**[Chorus]:**  
Weâ€™re young and wild, no limits in sight,  
With every step, igniting the night.  
Feel the bass, let it take control,  
In this moment, weâ€™re alive and whole.  

**[Hook]:**  
Oh, weâ€™re dancing through the chaos,  
Unfolding like a vibrant flower,  
Catching sparks, weâ€™re unstoppable,  
Our energy is pure power!  

**[Verse 2]:**  
From rooftops high, we'll share our truth,  
Living loud, embracing youth.  
Whispers of love in neon beams,  
In this wild ride, let go of dreams!  

**[Chorus]:**  
Weâ€™re young and wild, no limits in sight,  
With every step, igniting the night.  
Feel the bass, let it take control,  
In this moment, weâ€™re alive and whole.  

**[Bridge]:**  
So letâ€™s fly, letâ€™s rise above,  
Surrounded by stars and a world full of love.  
Weâ€™ll chart our own course, never conform,  
In this song of life, weâ€™ll dance through the storm.  

**[Chorus]:**  
Weâ€™re young and wild, no limits in sight,  
With every step, igniting the night.  
Feel the bass, let it take control,  
In this moment, weâ€™re alive and whole.  

**[Outro] [Instrumental]**
