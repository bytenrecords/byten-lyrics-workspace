**Title: "Spark the Night"**

**[intro] [instrumental]**

**[verse 1]**  
Hey there, got a feeling in the air,  
With a rhythm in my heart, can you feel the flare?  
Dancing under stars, let’s make it shine,  
Together we’ll create our very own rhyme!  

**[chorus]**  
So let’s spark the night, light up the sky,  
With colors and laughter, let’s fly high!  
Catch the spark, let it glow,  
In this moment, let’s steal the show!  

**[hook]**  
Ignite the flames, let our spirits soar,  
With every beat, we’ll crave for more!  
Feel the magic, oh can’t you see?  
This night is wild and so carefree!  

**[verse 2]**  
Shadows dancing, twirling all around,  
Join me now, let’s shake this ground!  
With every chorus, we’ll break the chains,  
In this whirlwind, love remains!  

**[chorus]**  
So let’s spark the night, light up the sky,  
With colors and laughter, let’s fly high!  
Catch the spark, let it glow,  
In this moment, let’s steal the show!  

**[outro] [instrumental]**  
Let the music play, never say goodbye,  
We’ll keep the spark, you and I!
