**Title: Neon Dreams (Refined)**

[intro]  
[Instrumental]

[verse 1]  
Underneath the stars where our secrets lie,  
The cityâ€™s heartbeat echoes, you and I glide.  
With every wayward smile, you light up the scene,  
A spark ignites our souls, like the stars that gleam.  

[chorus]  
Lost in the neon glow, we dance through the night,  
Chasing dreams alight, weâ€™ll hold on tight.  
In this city that never sleeps, weâ€™ll weave memories,  
With you by my side, itâ€™s a wild ride.  

[hook]  
Hey, weâ€™re running wild,  
Caution thrown to the breeze,  
Laughing like children,  
Living life with ease.  

[verse 2]  
Whispers in twilight, weâ€™re crafting our fate,  
Every fleeting moment, letâ€™s not hesitate.  
The world is ours to conquer, hand in hand we glide,  
In a tapestry of magic, our hearts open wide.  

[chorus]  
Lost in the neon glow, we dance through the night,  
Chasing dreams alight, weâ€™ll hold on tight.  
In this city that never sleeps, weâ€™ll weave memories,  
With you by my side, itâ€™s a wild ride.
