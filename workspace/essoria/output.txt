Hello Team,

I've gathered the song lyrics for "Echoes of Tomorrow" and am excited to present an improved version based on our collaborative contributions. I’ve reviewed Megan’s proposed piece and integrated some of the effective elements from previous drafts while adding my own flair. Below, you will find the improved lyrics, the various suggested styles of music, and the structure I've carefully constructed.

### **Improved Song Lyrics:**

**[intro] [instrumental]**  
In this crowded room, I feel alone,  
Chasing shadows beneath the city dome.  
Footsteps echo like whispers in my mind,  
Searching for a melody, one of a kind.  

**[verse 1]**  
Fading laughter, whispers in the night,  
Scrolling through memories, lost in the light.  
We wear our colors, bright yet discreet,  
Finding our voice in the chaos, bittersweet.  

**[chorus]**  
Raise your hands up, don’t be shy,  
We’re all stars in this endless sky.  
Together in rhythm, breaking the mold,  
In a world of grey, let’s let our truth be bold.  

**[verse 2]**  
Crossing borders, tales to unfold,  
From crayons to canvases, let dreams be told.  
Waves of resilience, we’ll ride the tide,  
Hand in hand, let’s take this wild ride.  

**[bridge]**  
The night whispers secrets, we'll dance with the past,  
Illuminated futures, let the shadows be cast.  
Every heartbeat echoes, we rise from the ground,  
With love as our anthem, let our voices resound.  

**[hook]**  
Oh, we’re young, wild, and free,  
Writing our anthem, just you and me.  
With every heartbeat, we'll shine and soar,  
Empowered by the love we explore.
