**Title: "Sparkle in the Sky"**

**[Intro] [Instrumental]**  
(Upbeat synths and cheerful guitar strumming)

**[Verse 1]**  
Hey there, world, can you feel the beat?  
Dancing on clouds, like life’s a treat.  
Chasing rainbows, painting dreams so bright,  
Let’s laugh and play, everything feels right!  

**[Chorus]**  
Oh, we’re shining, let our spirits fly,  
With every step, we’re reaching for the sky.  
No worries here, just a breeze in our hair,  
Life’s a carnival, let’s go anywhere!  

**[Hook]**  
Sparkle, sparkle, oh, can’t you see?  
Let the colors swirl, just you and me.  
In this moment, we’re alive and free,  
Come and dance with me, let’s just be!  

**[Verse 2]**  
Whispers of magic, in the evening glow,  
Footprints in stardust, we’re stealing the show.  
With every heartbeat, the music grows,  
Feel the rhythm, here’s where the fun flows!  

**[Chorus]**  
Oh, we’re shining, let our spirits fly,  
With every step, we’re reaching for the sky.  
No worries here, just a breeze in our hair,  
Life’s a carnival, let’s go anywhere!
