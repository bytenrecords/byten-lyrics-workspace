**Final Version of "Rhythm in Our Bones"**

**[Intro]**  
[Instrumental: Gentle synths build up, creating an atmosphere of a nighttime cityscape]

**[Verse 1:]**  
Late nights, street lights, we dance 'til the dawn,  
Electric hearts beat, in a world we belong,  
Whispers wrapped in shadows, secrets on our skin,  
Underneath the moonlight, let the chaos begin.

**[Chorus:]**  
Can you feel the rhythm in our bones?  
A melody of freedom, breaking down the stones,  
We're young and wild, chasing dreams in the dark,  
In this vibrant world, love’s the light we spark.

**[Hook:]**  
Hey, we’re unstoppable, no fear in our sway,  
Every heartbeat echoes, a truth we can’t betray.

**[Verse 2:]**  
Scrolling through the moments, lost in the screen,  
Memories flash like fireworks, bright and evergreen,  
A vibe that’s contagious, like fire in the rain,  
Every little heartbeat dances through the pain.

**[Chorus:]**  
Can you feel the rhythm in our bones?  
A melody of freedom, breaking down the stones,  
We're young and wild, chasing dreams in the dark,  
In this vibrant world, love’s the light we spark.

**[Outro:]**  
So let's rise with the sun, leaving worries behind,  
In the rhythm of our hearts, together, we will shine.
