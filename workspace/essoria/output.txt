**Title:** "Finding My Way"

**[Intro] [Instrumental]**  
(Setting a smooth, ethereal vibe with soft synth melodies that evoke a sense of calm anticipation.)

**[Verse 1]**  
In the mirror, I see a spark,  
A fire igniting, dispelling the dark.  
With every stumble, I learn to fly,  
Chasing shadows, I won’t say goodbye.

**[Chorus]**  
"Lost in the city lights, finding my way,  
With every heartbeat, I’m here to stay.  
Whispers of dreams, I’m breaking the mold,  
This is my story, watch it unfold."

**[Verse 2]**  
Footsteps echo on this winding road,  
Every heartbeat's lifting the load.  
Colors swirl as I paint my sky,  
I’m the artist, I’ll never comply.

**[Chorus]**  
"Lost in the city lights, finding my way,  
With every heartbeat, I’m here to stay.  
Whispers of dreams, I’m breaking the mold,  
This is my story, watch it unfold."

**[Hook]**  
Yeah, I rise up, rise up, breaking free,  
Living my truth, it’s all about me.  
In the chaos, I find my sound,  
With every heartbeat, I’m unbound.

**[Outro] [Instrumental]**  
(Fade out with captivating instrumental harmonies, echoing the themes of self-discovery and empowerment.)
