Hi Isadora,

Thank you for your patience! Here are the instructions for your task:

1. **Review of Megan's Lyrics**: Focus on capturing the emotional weight of the themes, as Megan has been working on lyrics related to love and self-discovery. Make sure to retain the authenticity of her voice while enhancing the lyrical depth.

2. **Suggestions from Kyoichitsu**: Kyoichitsu will suggest integrating metaphors and imagery that elevate the emotional impact. Look for those suggestions once they are received, and see how they can enhance Megan's original work.

3. **Music Styles**: For the song, consider genres that reflect a modern yet timeless feel. Suggested styles can include:
   - Indie Pop
   - R&B
   - Alternative Rock
   - Synth-Pop
   - Acoustic Folk

4. **Title Inspiration**: Keep the title reflective of the overarching theme, such as “Chasing Echoes” or “Unveiled Heart.”

5. **Structure**: Ensure to assemble the final lyrics with the requested sections wrapped in brackets, starting with [intro] [instrumental].

Once you have these instructions applied, feel free to craft the new lyrics and share them back for review.

Looking forward to your creative output!

Best,
