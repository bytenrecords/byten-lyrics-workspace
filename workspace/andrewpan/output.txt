Subject: Finalizing "Chasing Daydreams" Track

Hi Team,

I’ve successfully gathered the versions from Megan and Essoria, and I’m in the process of refining our song "Chasing Daydreams." Given the consistency in the lyrics from both, I will ensure that the best parts shine in the final version. 

### Structure:
**[Intro] [Instrumental]**  
(Gentle strumming of an acoustic guitar, light percussion building up)

**[Verse 1]**  
Under the sun, we dance like leaves,  
Whispering hopes on a breeze that believes,  
Every moment shines, oh can’t you see?  
Life’s a canvas, we’re wild and free.

**[Chorus]**  
Chasing daydreams, where the colors play,  
Laughing with the stars, as we drift away,  
Throwing caution to the wind, let our spirits sway,  
In this magical moment, we’ll find our way.

**[Hook]**  
Now’s the time, let’s ignite the night,  
With every heartbeat, everything feels right,  
Chasing daydreams, never out of sight,  
Together we’re shining, like the city lights.

**[Verse 2]**  
Ride the waves like a rollercoaster,  
With you beside me, I'm a heart that's bolder,  
Adventure calling, every turn a twist,  
In this playful rhythm, how could we resist?

**[Chorus]**  
Chasing daydreams, where the colors play,  
Laughing with the stars, as we drift away,  
Throwing caution to the wind, let our spirits sway,  
In this magical moment, we’ll find our way.

**[Outro] [Instrumental]**  
(Fading out with a playful melody, the sound of laughter blending with music)

### Music Styles:
- Pop
- Indie Folk
- Acoustic
- Upbeat Rock
- Electropop

I will finalize the title as "Chasing Daydreams" since it resonates well with the theme and the vibe of our lyrics. 

If Kyoichitsu or Stancsz have additional input, I would appreciate it, though it seems we may need to resolve the issues with their submissions. 

Looking forward to your thoughts or suggestions!

Best,  
Andrew Pan
