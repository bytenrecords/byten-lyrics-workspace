Subject: Request for Accessible Lyric Drafts

Hi Team,

It looks like we’re facing some encoding issues with the lyric drafts from Megan and Kyoichitsu. In order to move forward and finalize our track, I need your help to access the content in a readable format. Here are my suggestions:

1. **Text Editors**: If you haven't already, please try opening the files with a text editor like Notepad++ or Sublime Text. These tools are better equipped to handle encoding problems, and we might be able to view the content correctly.

2. **Copy and Paste**: If the above doesn’t yield results, I would appreciate it if someone could copy the content directly from the files and paste it into our conversation. This way, I can review and refine the lyrics as necessary.

3. **New Drafts**: Should we be unable to recover the content, it might be helpful for Megan to resend the lyrics to me via email. Alternatively, a brief summary of the themes and mood she was aiming for would also suffice for now.

Once I have access to the correct lyrics, I will focus on selecting the strongest elements to craft a final version that shines. I will also include 3-5 relevant music styles and finalize a catchy title.

Thank you all for your swift attention to this matter. I look forward to receiving the needed content soon so we can keep this project moving smoothly.

Best,
