Subject: Finalizing "Unbound Echoes"

Hi Team,

I appreciate the contributions from everyone on our latest track, "Unbound Echoes." I've reviewed the outputs from Megan, Essoria, and while Kyoichitsu's submission couldn't be processed, I believe we've gathered enough material to create a strong final version.

Here's what I've compiled, keeping the structure intact with polished lyrical changes:

---

**Title: Unbound Echoes**

**[Intro] [Instrumental]**  
(A gentle electric piano introduces the vibe, gradually blending in rhythmic layers)

**[Verse 1]**  
"Lost in the echoes of my mind,  
Chasing the fragments left behind.  
In a world that hums and shouts,  
I’ll weave through the noise, no doubts."

**[Chorus]**  
"Hey, I’m unbound,  
Shattering illusions draped in despair.  
Hearing my sound,  
In colors that dance through the air."

**[Hook]**  
"Let’s rejoice, for we are alive,  
In this moment, we truly thrive.  
Dare to shine, just like the stars,  
We’re crafting our own memoirs."

**[Verse 2]**  
"Turning the pages, rewriting fate,  
Illuminating paths through love and hate.  
Our essence flickers in the night,  
Together, we’ll ignite the light."

**[Chorus]**  
"Hey, I’m unbound,  
Shattering illusions draped in despair.  
Hearing my sound,  
In colors that dance through the air."

**[Outro] [Instrumental]**  
(Gradually fading out with rich harmonies and a smooth, rhythmic beat)

**Music Styles:**  
Alternative R&B, Indie Pop, Neo-Soul, Chillwave, Electro-Pop  

The lyrics maintain our core themes of self-discovery and individuality while enhancing emotional resonance. I am excited about how this can connect with our Gen Z audience and hope to hear your thoughts or any final adjustments you’d like to propose.

Let’s make this track shine!

Best,
