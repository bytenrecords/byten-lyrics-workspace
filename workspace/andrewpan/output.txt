**Subject:** Finalizing "Chasing Neon Dreams" Track

Hi Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I’ve gathered the lyric contributions from both Megan and Essoria and noted the issue with Kyoichitsu’s file, which I will follow up on separately. 

Here’s the structure I've shaped from the drafts along with the final title. The lyrics maintain their original essence but have been standardized for clarity and flow.

**Title:** "Chasing Neon Dreams"

**[Intro] [Instrumental]**

**[Verse 1]**  
"In a city that never sleeps, we’re chasing dreams,  
With neon lights flickering, casting midnight schemes.  
Lost in a world that moves so fast,  
But our connection, oh, it’s built to last."  

**[Chorus]**  
"Under the stars, just you and me,  
Dancing to the rhythm of our destiny.  
In this moment, we’re wild and free,  
Let’s paint the sky with our melody."  

**[Hook]**  
"Chasing neon dreams in the moonlight,  
With you by my side, everything feels right.  
Let’s make this night our own delight,  
Together we shine, like the city bright."  

**[Verse 2]**  
"Whispers in the wind, secrets we share,  
A spark in your eyes, I stop and stare.  
With every heartbeat, we’re spinning around,  
In this tangled web, our love is found."  

**[Chorus]**  
"Under the stars, just you and me,  
Dancing to the rhythm of our destiny.  
In this moment, we’re wild and free,  
Let’s paint the sky with our melody."  

**[Bridge]**  
"Silhouettes in the dark, we’ll never fade,  
Waves of emotion in the choices we made.  
Lost in the magic of this urban night,  
Hand in hand, we’ll take flight."  

**[Chorus]**  
"Under the stars, just you and me,  
Dancing to the rhythm of our destiny.  
In this moment, we’re wild and free,  
Let’s paint the sky with our melody."  

**[Outro] [Instrumental]**

**Music Styles:** Alternative R&B, Dream Pop, Indie Pop, Chillwave, Synthwave

I believe this final version retains the emotional core and vibrancy we set out to capture. Please review and share any additional thoughts or adjustments you may have. 

Let’s finalize this beautiful piece and make it shine!

Best,
