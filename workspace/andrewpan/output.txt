---

**Title: Neon Dreams**

**[Intro] [Instrumental]**  
*Sparkling synths and soft beats setting the mood…*

**[Verse 1]**  
Underglow lights, our shadows sway,  
In this city, we’ll find our way,  
Whispers echo, our secrets laid bare,  
With every heartbeat, drifting somewhere.

**[Chorus]**  
Under neon lights, we dance,  
Moments fleeting, take a chance,  
Hearts entwined like morning mist,  
Caught in dreams, we can’t resist.

**[Verse 2]**  
Midnight hues paint our scene,  
Laughing wild, we feel so free,  
Say the words you never knew,  
Fading worries, just me and you.

**[Chorus]**  
Under neon lights, we dance,  
Moments fleeting, take a chance,  
Hearts entwined like morning mist,  
Caught in dreams, we can’t resist.

**[Hook]**  
Come with me, let’s chase the stars,  
Running wild, no matter how far,  
In this glow, we don’t feel time,  
Caught in rhythm, your heartbeat aligns.

**[Bridge]**  
We’ll chase the sunrise, lost in each other’s eyes,  
Life’s a canvas, let’s paint our skies,  
Through all the chaos, we’ll find our way,  
Together in this dream, let’s not fade away.

**[Chorus]**  
Under neon lights, we dance,  
Moments fleeting, take a chance,  
Hearts entwined like morning mist,  
Caught in dreams, we can’t resist.

**[Outro] [Instrumental]**  
*The beat slows down, fading out while leaving a lingering melody…*
