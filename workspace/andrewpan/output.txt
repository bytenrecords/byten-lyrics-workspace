Subject: Finalizing "Electric Dreams"

Hi Team,

I've gathered the lyrics and feedback from Essoria and Stan's contributions. I also tried to access Megan's and Kyoichitsu’s submissions, but unfortunately, there were issues reading those files. We can decide to move forward without them for now, or I can attempt to retrieve that information again later.

Here are the refined lyrics we have with the structure and music styles included:

**Title: "Electric Dreams"**

**[Intro]**  
In a world that’s alive, we’re ready to thrive,  
Underneath the stars, our spirits collide.

**[Verse 1]**  
In this city colored bright, shadows dance under neon lights,  
Lost in the rush, we find our place, hearts on fire, it’s a wild chase.  
Chasing dreams while the world sleeps, whispers of secrets the night keeps.  
We’re the vibe, we’re the groove, let’s break the chains and move.

**[Chorus]**  
So let’s ride the waves, the tides of today,  
With every beat, we’ll find our way.  
No regrets, just a chance to feel,  
This is our moment, let’s make it real.

**[Verse 2]**  
Through the rhythm of our hearts, we’ll make a spark,  
Every step forward, lighting up the dark.  
Lose yourself in the sound, let it lift you high,  
We’re infinite, we’re limitless, reaching for the sky.

**[Chorus]**  
So let’s ride the waves, the tides of today,  
With every beat, we’ll find our way.  
No regrets, just a chance to feel,  
This is our moment, let’s make it real.

**[Bridge]**  
In the whispers of the night, we’ll make our dreams take flight,  
With every pulse, we’re alive, together, we’ll survive.  
Let the rhythm take control, it’s the song within our soul,  
Bringing us together, the universe unfolds.

**[Chorus]**  
So let’s ride the waves, the tides of today,  
With every beat, we’ll find our way.  
No regrets, just a chance to feel,  
This is our moment, let’s make it real.

**[Outro]**  
In this dance of fate, let’s celebrate,  
With love in our hearts, we’re never late.  
Electric dreams will guide our way,  
Together we’ll shine, come what may.
