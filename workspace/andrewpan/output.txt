**Email Draft to the Team as Andrew Pan**

Subject: Finalizing "Chasing Stars" - Collaboration and Next Steps

Dear Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I’ve begun synthesizing the inputs from Megan and Essoria, along with Kyoichitsu's contributions (though I’m still awaiting a more comprehensive insight from them due to a reading error). The initial foundation they provided is quite solid, and I've outlined our plan to shape it into a polished final track.

**Current Structure for "Chasing Stars":**

**[intro]**  
(Instrumental: Soft synths and gentle beats build up)

**[verse 1]**  
The themes emphasize our shared dreams and the vibrant heartbeat of the city, fostering a youthful spirit.

**[chorus]**  
Capturing the essence of wildness and losing ourselves in the music, this section is magnetic.

**[hook]**  
Encapsulating transient joy and the idea of living for today, this part distinctly resonates.

**[verse 2]**  
Reimagining personal journeys with bold narratives—we're truly painting our dreams with every step.

**[outro]**  
(Instrumental fades out, ensuring we leave the listeners on a high note.)

**Music Styles:**  
I propose we maintain a blend of Alternative R&B, Synthpop, Indie Pop, Dream Pop, and Chillwave to appeal broadly while creating an uplifting experience.

Moving forward, I’d like to focus on refining our lyrical structure further, ensuring we emphasize emotional connection and storytelling that resonates with our audience. 

Please take a moment to review the current structure and share any additional feedback or creative input you may have. Let’s aim to finalize the title soon, ideally something that encapsulates the spirit of our song.

Looking forward to your thoughts!

Best regards,
