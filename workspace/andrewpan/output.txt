Subject: Finalizing "Spark the Night"

Hi team,

I've gathered the lyrics from Megan and Essoria for the song titled "Spark the Night." Kyoichitsu's submission didn’t come through due to a file reading error, so I’ll focus on the versions I have to create the final draft.

**Merged Lyrics Overview:**
Both Megan and Essoria's inputs align closely, and I'll use their work to maintain cohesion while ensuring the song resonates emotionally. Below, I’ll maintain the structure while refining the lyrics for clarity and flow.

### **Title: "Spark the Night"**

**[intro] [instrumental]**

**[verse 1]**  
Hey there, got a feeling in the air,  
With a rhythm in my heart, can you feel the flare?  
Dancing under stars, let’s make it shine,  
Together we’ll create our very own rhyme!  

**[chorus]**  
So let’s spark the night, light up the sky,  
With colors and laughter, let’s fly high!  
Catch the spark, let it glow,  
In this moment, let’s steal the show!  

**[hook]**  
Ignite the flames, let our spirits soar,  
With every beat, we’ll crave for more!  
Feel the magic, oh can’t you see?  
This night is wild and so carefree!  

**[verse 2]**  
Shadows dancing, twirling all around,  
Join me now, let’s shake this ground!  
With every chorus, we’ll break the chains,  
In this whirlwind, love remains!  

**[chorus]**  
So let’s spark the night, light up the sky,  
With colors and laughter, let’s fly high!  
Catch the spark, let it glow,  
In this moment, let’s steal the show!  

**[outro] [instrumental]**  
Let the music play, never say goodbye,  
We’ll keep the spark, you and I!  

### **Refinements:**
- Polished the language to enhance the lyrical flow.
- Maintained thematic focus on joy and unity, reflecting the song’s uplifting vibe.

### **Final Music Styles:**
- Pop

I believe this version successfully encapsulates the essence of both lyricists, and I’m excited to move forward with it. If there are any additional changes or insights you’d like to share, please let me know.
