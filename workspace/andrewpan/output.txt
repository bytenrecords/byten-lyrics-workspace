Subject: Finalizing "Neon Dreams"

Hi Team,

I've gathered the lyrics from Megan and Essoria for our upcoming track "Neon Dreams." Here’s an overview of the structure I've compiled based on what we have:

---

**Title:** "Neon Dreams"

**[Intro]**  
[Instrumental]

**[Verse 1]**  
In electric whispers, we come alive,  
Colors swirl, it's a vibrant dive.  
Chasing shadows that shimmer and sway,  
Together we'll dance till the break of day.

**[Chorus]**  
Underneath the neon skies, we chase our dreams, never compromise.  
In this hyper-speed, we find our beat, together we rise.  
With every heartbeat, we’ll never fade,  
In a world that spins, we’ll make our parade.

**[Verse 2]**  
Lost in the rhythm, we’re unconfined,  
With every moment, leaving doubts behind.  
Waves of laughter, echoes so sweet,  
In our sanctuary, we’ll never retreat.

**[Chorus]**  
Underneath the neon skies, we chase our dreams, never compromise.  
In this hyper-speed, we find our beat, together we rise.  
With every heartbeat, we’ll never fade,  
In a world that spins, we’ll make our parade.

**[Hook]**  
Let’s light it up, let the magic glow,  
In this fleeting night, we'll steal the show.  
Hand in hand, let’s make our own fate,  
Dancing to the rhythm, let’s elevate!

**Music Styles:**  
- Alternative R&B  
- Indie Pop  
- Electronic  
- Dream Pop  
- Vaporwave

Refinements included: correcting encoding issues and enhancing the emotional undertone for a vibe that is smooth and vibrant - just as intended!

I will incorporate Kyoichitsu’s input once it's available and make sure we pick the strongest elements to finalize our piece. Together, we can craft something truly special. 

Looking forward to your feedback!

Best,
