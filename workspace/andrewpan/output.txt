Subject: Finalizing "Chasing Stars" Track

Hi Team,

I hope this message finds you well! I've gathered the lyrics from Megan and Essoria, and while I faced an error with Kyoichitsu's input, I believe we can work with the strong foundations laid down so far.

**[Intro] [Instrumental]**

---

**[Verse 1]:**  
In the city lights, where dreams ignite,  
We chase the stars, we’ll be alright.  
Got each other’s backs, through every fight,  
Let’s make some noise, bring our hearts to life.

---

**[Chorus]:**  
We’re the generation, breaking the mold,  
With every beat, watch our story unfold.  
Dancing on the edge, feeling so bold,  
Together we rise, let the future be told.

---

**[Hook]:**  
Oh, oh, we’re alive tonight,  
With every heartbeat, we're taking flight.  
Oh, oh, under the neon glow,  
Hand in hand, we’ll steal the show!

---

**[Verse 2]:**  
Through the whispers of dreams that we chased,  
We color the sky, no moment goes to waste.  
With hopes like fire, we’ll light up the space,  
In this rhythm of love, we’ll always find grace.

---

**[Chorus]:**  
We’re the generation, breaking the mold,  
With every beat, watch our story unfold.  
Dancing on the edge, feeling so bold,  
Together we rise, let the future be told.

---

**[Bridge]:**  
In the cherry blossoms, we find our way,  
Words unspoken, in the games we play.  
With laughter echoing like a sweet serenade,  
Our love’s a language, never afraid.

---

**[Chorus]:**  
We’re the generation, breaking the mold,  
With every beat, watch our story unfold.  
Dancing on the edge, feeling so bold,  
Together we rise, let the future be told.

---

**[Outro] [Instrumental]:**  
(Soft fade out with an upbeat rhythm, encouraging listeners to dance)

I've aimed to keep the structure efficient and cohesive, incorporating cultural references that will resonate with our target audience. Please review and share any suggestions or additional input you may have, especially regarding melody and arrangement.

Looking forward to wrapping this up!

Best,
