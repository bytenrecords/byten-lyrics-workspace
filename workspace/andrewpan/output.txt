Subject: Finalizing Our New Track

Hi Team,

I've gathered the inputs from Isadora, Megan, Kyoichitsu, and Stan, and I’m ready to shape everything into our final track. Here’s the structured layout I’m proposing, which I believe captures the strongest elements of the contributions while staying true to our vision.

**[Intro]**  
"In this world of endless noise,  
Your heartbeat is my anchored choice."

**[Verse 1]**  
"In a world that feels so loud,  
I find peace in your silence.  
Storms may rage, we’ll stand our ground,  
Dancing in this state of defiance."

**[Chorus]**  
"You and I, we’re shining bright,  
Even in the dark, we’ll ignite,  
With our dreams that intertwine,  
We’ll rise above, you’ll be my light."

**[Verse 2]**  
"Whispers of tomorrow call,  
As we break down every wall.  
Together we'll paint the skies,  
With colors of our love that never dies."

**[Bridge]**  
(Megan and Kyoichitsu’s contributions will be included after further review.)

For music styles, I am confirming the following:  
1. Alternative R&B  
2. Indie Pop  
3. Neo-Soul  
4. Lo-fi Chill  
5. Dream Pop  

I think “Defiance” resonates well as the title, encapsulating both strength and resilience, themes we've effectively communicated in our lyrics.

Please review this structure and let me know your thoughts or any additional ideas you’d like me to incorporate. I'm excited about how it's shaping up, and I appreciate everyone's creative contributions!

Best,
