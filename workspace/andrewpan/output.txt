Subject: Final Track Compilation - "Echoes of Yesterday"

Hi Team,

I've reviewed the entries from Essoria and Megan, along with the output from Kyoichitsu, and I will compile the lyrics into the best version for our track titled **"Echoes of Yesterday."** Below is the framework I’ve structured after analyzing their contributions, while also addressing placeholders where necessary.

**Final Version of "Echoes of Yesterday"**

**[Intro] [Instrumental]**

**[Verse 1]**  
When the sun sets low, shadows start to sway,  
Whispers of the night guide us to stay.  
In a world so vibrant, colors blend and play,  
Chasing dreams together, come, let’s find our way.

**[Chorus]**  
Oh, we're the story still unfolding,  
Hearts ablaze, forever holding.  
With every beat, our hearts are molding,  
In this moment, love's exploding.

**[Hook]**  
Let’s dance through the echoes of yesterday,  
With every step, we break away.

**[Verse 2]**  
Underneath the stars, secrets come alive,  
We’ll paint our tomorrows in the midnight sky.  
With your hand in mine, we will learn to fly,  
Boundless like the ocean, where dreams don’t die.

**[Chorus]**  
Oh, we're the story still unfolding,  
Hearts ablaze, forever holding.  
With every beat, our hearts are molding,  
In this moment, love's exploding.

**[Bridge]**  
So let the music take its toll,  
Feel the rhythm deep in your soul.  
We’re the fire, we own the night,  
Together we ignite the light.

I've ensured to blend the strongest elements from both Megan and Essoria's submissions, retaining a coherent narrative while highlighting the poetic phrases they crafted. The compilation reflects a rich emotional tapestry consistent with our genre focus.

If there are any additional elements or changes you would like to suggest, please let me know. Looking forward to your feedback!

Best,
