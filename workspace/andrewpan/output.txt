**Instructions confirmed, awaiting responses from the owner regarding the requested guidance on lyrics.** 

Once the instructions are received, I will proceed to consolidate any revisions made by Kyoichitsu and Megan, and select the best improvements based on the given details. 

In the meantime, hereâ€™s a brief outline of the next steps as part of my role:

1. Monitor for owner's responses to Kyoichitsu and Megan concerning their respective inquiries.
2. Review and gather feedback/inputs from Kyoichitsu regarding any potential improvements to existing lyrics.
3. Assess Megan's new lyrics draft once it's completed after receiving the owner's guidance.
4. Consolidate any song improvements and finalize the best options following the required format.

I remain prepared to execute these tasks as soon as the necessary instructions are obtained. Please stay tuned for updates!
