**Title: "Chasing Rainbows"**  
**Music Styles:** Pop, Indie, Folk, Dance, Acoustic  

**[intro] [instrumental]**

**[verse 1]**  
When the sun peeks through the clouds,  
A dance begins, the world feels loud,  
Colors swirling, hearts ablaze,  
Let’s get lost in this tender haze.

**[chorus]**  
Chasing rainbows, side by side,  
Through the valleys, let love guide,  
Life's a canvas, let's paint it bright,  
With laughter echoing, dreams take flight.

**[hook]**  
Oh-oh, oh-oh, let’s chase the light,  
Oh-oh, oh-oh, everything's alright!  

**[verse 2]**  
Underneath the starlit skies,  
Whispers of magic in our eyes,  
Together we’ll compose our song,  
With every step, we'll find where we belong.

**[chorus]**  
Chasing rainbows, side by side,  
Through the valleys, let love guide,  
Life's a canvas, let's paint it bright,  
With laughter echoing, dreams take flight.

**[hook]**  
Oh-oh, oh-oh, let’s chase the light,  
Oh-oh, oh-oh, everything's alright!  

**[outro] [instrumental]**
