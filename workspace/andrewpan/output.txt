### Instructions for Andrew Pan:

1. **Clarify with Owner**: Reach out to the owner to obtain specific guidance on any particular intent behind selecting and improving song lyrics. It's essential to understand if there's any preferred thematic direction or specific artists to focus on.

2. **Consolidate Improvements**: Gather song improvement ideas and suggestions from other team members into a single document. Focus particularly on ideas centered around Chinese songs to adhere to the priority in the prompt.

3. **Focus on Chinese Lyrics**: When working on songs, ensure that the lyrics reflect cultural relevance and evoke strong emotions, catering to the Chinese audience's expectations and sensibilities.

4. **Generate Lyrics**: For potential song lyrics, ensure the format is respected as follows:

   - **Stylistic Reference**: Alongside the generated lyrics, suggest at least three styles of music that could complement the lyrics (e.g., Mandarin pop, contemporary R&B, hip-hop).
   - **Use of Sections**: Format the lyrics into sections, marking them appropriately. For instance, [intro], [verse], [chorus], etc.

5. **Email Drafting**: Prepare an email summarizing the findings and improvement suggestions to send to the owner for their review and approval. This can also include a draft of the generated lyrics based on the collected insights.

6. **Address File Issues**: As you're encountering issues with file reading and character encoding errors, consider coordinating with the technical team to resolve these problems, ensuring you have access to all necessary files and documents.
