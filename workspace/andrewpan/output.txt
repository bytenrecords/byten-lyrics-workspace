Subject: Finalizing Track with Collaborations

Dear Team,

I have gathered feedback from Megan, Kyoichi, and Stan regarding the drafts, and I’ll be consolidating these ideas into our final track. Here’s the plan moving forward:

1. **Structure**: I will maintain the structure of the lyrics with [intro], [verse], [chorus], etc.
   
2. **Incorporating Feedback**: 
   - I appreciate the use of vivid imagery as highlighted by Kyoichi and Stan. I’ll ensure we retain these visual elements while making necessary tweaks for better flow and relatability.
   - I’ll refine the lines pointed out by Kyoichi to enhance clarity while preserving the core message.

3. **Music Styles**: I’m considering incorporating elements from alternative R&B, pop, and perhaps some electronic influences to align with our target audience, especially the Gen Z demographic.

4. **Title**: I’ll brainstorm a few potential titles that encapsulate the essence of our lyrics and overall vibe.

I’ll aim to finalize the version by next week, so please feel free to send any further contributions by then. Let's make this track shine!

Best,  
Andrew Pan
