I am ready to proceed with the compilation and selection of the best lyrical improvements once we receive the owner's instructions. In the interim, here are the summarized contributions from Kyoichitsu and Megan based on improvements and fresh drafts generated.

### Kyoichitsu's Contributions:

### Megan's Approach:
- Awaiting the ownerâ€™s response regarding the theme, title, and style before composing new lyrics.

Once the owner provides the necessary details, I will gather inputs from both Kyoichitsu and Megan, along with my suggestions, and present the finalized lyrics in the required format.

### Awaiting Owner's Instructions:
