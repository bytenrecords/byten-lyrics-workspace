Subject: Collaboration on Final Track - "Chasing Neon Dreams"

Hi Team,

I hope this email finds you well! I’ve gathered the lyrics from Megan and Essoria, along with Kyoichitsu’s future contributions, to shape them into the best possible final track for "Chasing Neon Dreams." Below is a structured draft that includes refined elements and a focus on maintaining the essence of our original concept while enhancing lyrical flow and emotional resonance.

### **Title:** Chasing Neon Dreams

**[Intro]**  
(Upbeat synths and groovy bass to elevate the playful essence)

**[Verse 1]**  
Chasing dreams in neon hues,  
Igniting nights, it’s me and you,  
Heartbeat syncing with city’s pulse,  
Our adventure’s written, no need to coax.  

**[Chorus]**  
When the stars ignite the sky,  
We’ll dance until the dawn is nigh,  
In this moment, everything's right,  
Together, let’s illuminate the night!  

**[Hook]**  
Oh-oh-oh, let's break away,  
In this vibrant world, we’ll sway,  
Oh-oh-oh, hearts reach the sky,  
With every beat, together we’ll fly!  

**[Verse 2]**  
In the rhythm, we find our place,  
Through the chaos, we embrace,  
Electric vibes coursing through our veins,  
Living in the now, casting off the chains.  

**[Chorus]**  
When the stars ignite the sky,  
We’ll dance until the dawn is nigh,  
In this moment, everything's right,  
Together, let’s illuminate the night!  

**[Outro]**  
(Instrumental fade out with playful chants)  
Let’s run away... let’s run away...
