Subject: Finalizing "Chasing Dreams"

Hi Team,

I’ve gathered the lyrics from Megan and Essoria. Kyoichitsu’s input is unfortunately unreadable due to a file encoding issue, but from the contents we have, we can move forward. Here’s a consolidated overview of the song “Chasing Dreams” including how we can refine and finalize it.

**Title: "Chasing Dreams"**

**[Intro]**  
*[Instruments: Bright guitar strums and a bubbly synth]*  
*Hey there, let’s take a ride,  
On a cloud of hopes and dreams we hide.*

**[Verse 1]**  
Oh, the sun is shining bright,  
With every little spark, we feel alive!  
We’ll dance through the city streets,  
With laughter in our hearts, nothing can compete!  

**[Chorus]**  
We’re chasing dreams, let’s take flight,  
With a little bit of magic in our sights.  
No limits here, just you and me,  
In this wild, beautiful symphony!  

**[Hook]**  
Ooh, ooh, let’s make it last,  
A moment so sweet, let’s hold it fast!  
Ooh, ooh, we’ll sing out loud,  
With a heart full of joy, we’re feeling proud!  

**[Verse 2]**  
With every twist and turn we make,  
We'll find new paths, there's no mistake!  
In every story that unfolds,  
We’ll paint the world with colors bold.  

**[Chorus]**  
We’re chasing dreams, let’s take flight,  
With a little bit of magic in our sights.  
No limits here, just you and me,  
In this wild, beautiful symphony!  

**[Outro]**  
*[Instruments fade softly]*  
*So let’s keep dreaming, through the night,  
With love in our hearts, everything feels right.*  

**Music Styles:** Pop, Indie, Folk, Electro-Pop, Acoustic
