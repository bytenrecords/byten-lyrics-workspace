### New Song Creation Guidance  

Hello team,  

As we venture into our next project, I’d like to share some ideas and instructions for our upcoming lyrics creation process. Let’s harness our creativity to produce captivating songs that resonate with today’s youth.  

### Ideas for New Lyrics Creation  

1. **Emotional Journeys:** Explore the highs and lows of young adulthood, focusing on mental health, self-discovery, and emotional resilience.  

2. **Cultural Diversity:** Weave in themes that celebrate multicultural identities with imagery that resonates across various backgrounds, helping listeners feel included.  

3. **Social Commentary:** Address pressing contemporary issues such as **social justice**, **climate change**, and **inclusivity**, tapping into the sentiments that Gen Z holds dear.  

4. **Fictional Narratives:** Craft engaging storylines that transport listeners to imaginative worlds, encouraging escapism while keeping them grounded in reality.  

### Instructions for the Team  

- **Song Language:** We'll be focusing on writing new songs in **Chinese**, **Japanese**, and **English** to broaden our global reach and appeal.  

- **Collaboration Deadline:** Please submit all drafts by **next Friday** for a comprehensive review. I will provide feedback and suggestions afterward to refine our ideas.  

- **Lyric Themes:** Center your lyrics on concepts that resonate with Gen Z, emphasizing values such as **authenticity**, **empowerment**, and **cultural awareness**.  

- **Genre Experimentation:** Don’t hesitate to explore innovative fusions within modern genres! Consider blends of **alternative R&B**, **lo-fi chill**, and **synthwave**, integrating traditional sounds to create something fresh and unique.  

Let’s pour our creativity into these projects and produce music that truly reflects the voice of our generation! I’m excited to see what each of you comes up with.  

Best,
