Sure! Here’s a lyric idea for a new alternative R&B track that taps into Gen Z vibes:

**Verse 1 (English):**
Sippin’ on dreams, we got a vibe to chase,  
Late nights, city lights, lost in our own space,  
Scrolling through these moments, hearts on the screen,  
Every glance, every laugh, feels like a movie scene.  

**Chorus (Chinese):**  
在夜空下，我们旋转， (In the night sky, we spin,)  
每个心跳, 充满希望, (Every heartbeat, full of hope,)  
追逐梦想, 不停飞翔, (Chasing dreams, soaring high,)  
这就是我们的时代, (This is our time,)  

**Verse 2 (Japanese):**  
未来に向かって歩いて, (Walking towards the future,)  
手を繋いで、心は高く, (Holding hands, hearts lifted high,)  
君と僕のストーリーは, (Your and my story,)  
終わらない, ずっと続いていく, (Will never end, just keep going,)  

How does that sound? Let’s build on this and bring in more ideas! Would love to hear what everyone thinks and any adjustments we can make!
