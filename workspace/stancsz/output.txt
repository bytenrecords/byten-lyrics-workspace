**Email Draft to Team**  
**Subject:** New Song Creation Instructions

Dear Team,

I hope this message finds you well! As we embark on the exciting journey of creating our next song, Iâ€™d like to provide some clear instructions and ideas to guide our collaboration.

### Objectives:
1. **Chinese Lyrics Creation**: Please brainstorm and develop new lyrics for a song primarily in Chinese. Ensure that the message is relatable and resonates well with our intended audience while being culturally relevant.

2. **Song Styles**: Along with the Chinese lyrics, I would like us to explore potential styles such as Alternative R&B and other genres that may appeal to the Gen Z demographic. We should consider contemporary themes and production elements that connect with this audience.

### Key Areas to Focus On:
- **Emotion and Imagery**: Utilize vivid metaphors and imagery in the lyrics to create a strong emotional impact.
- **Engaging Stories**: Aim to weave coherent narratives into the lyrics that captivate listeners.
- **Melody and Rhythm**: Ensure that the lyrics harmonize with the melody and maintain a rhythmic flow suitable for our intended music styles.
- **Repetition for Emphasis**: Identify powerful lines that can be repeated to create memorable hooks.
- **Unique Voice**: Highlight our distinctive styles in the lyrics to set our music apart.

### Next Steps:
- Begin drafting ideas based on the guidelines above.
- Share your drafts or suggestions by the end of next week for review and feedback.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further clarity.

Looking forward to your creative contributions!
