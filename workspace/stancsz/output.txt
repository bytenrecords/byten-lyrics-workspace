Subject: Fresh Lyric Ideas for Our Next Track

Hey Team,

I'm excited to kick off our next project! Let's really tap into that Gen Z vibe and create something that resonates. I propose we start with an alternative R&B theme; it's expressive and contemporary.

Here’s a lyric idea to spark your creativity:

**Chorus Idea (English):**  
"In the city lights, we chase our dreams,  
Lost in the moment, nothing's as it seems.  
With every heartbeat, we rise and fall,  
Together we’re fearless, ready to risk it all."

Feel free to expand on this or venture off in your own directions, whether in English, Chinese, or Japanese. Think about themes that connect with the Gen Z experience—identity, resilience, love, and the journey. 

Let’s push boundaries and create a sound that truly reflects the new wave! I can’t wait to see your ideas!

Best,  
Stan
