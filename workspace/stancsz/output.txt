Subject: New Track Idea - Let's Get Creative!

Hey team,

I’m excited to dive into this new track together! I think we should aim for something that reflects the bold energy of our brand while connecting with the Gen Z audience. How about we explore an alternative R&B vibe that combines smooth melodies with thought-provoking lyrics?

Here’s a lyric idea to kick things off:

(English)
"In the city lights, we chase our dreams,  
Through the highs and lows, breaking at the seams.  
Heartbeat syncs with the rhythm of the night,  
We’re the stars, shining, ready to ignite."

I encourage everyone to expand on this idea. Feel free to add your own verses, or let’s experiment with writing in Chinese or Japanese to really capture diverse influences. Remember, the goal is to push boundaries and create something fresh and exciting.

Let’s brainstorm and share our ideas in the next couple of days. Looking forward to seeing what you all come up with!

Best,  
Stan
