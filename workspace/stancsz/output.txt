Hey team!

I’m excited to take on this creative challenge with you! Let’s kick it off with a lyric idea that captures the essence of alternative R&B while resonating with a Gen Z audience. 

How about we explore themes of self-discovery and empowerment, set against a backdrop of modern relationships? Here’s a potential opening verse in English:

**Verse Idea:**
"Lost in the city lights, chasing dreams we can’t define,  
Falling stars whisper secrets, they’re yours and they’re mine.  
With every heartbreak echo, we rise and redefine,  
In this world of chaos, your heartbeat feels like a sign."

I encourage everyone to riff off this idea or bring in your own language and style! Let’s blend some cool beats with fresh lyrics—make sure we keep that bold edge. I’m looking forward to seeing what we can create together!

Keep those ideas flowing!

Best,  
Stan
