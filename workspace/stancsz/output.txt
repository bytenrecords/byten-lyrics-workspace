Subject: Let's Craft Something Fresh!

Hey Team!

I hope you’re all pumped as I am because we're about to cook up some new magic! I want to hear your thoughts on a new track that embodies that alternative R&B vibe—something that’s not just catchy, but resonates with the Gen Z crowd. 

Here’s my lyric idea to get the ball rolling:

**Verse Idea (English):**  
"In the midnight glow, we chase the stars,  
Lost in the rhythm, healing our scars.  
With every heartbeat, we’ll redefine,  
This electric love, it’s yours and mine."

Feel free to tweak it or take inspiration from it! Remember, you can write in Chinese, Japanese, or English. Let's think bold and innovative! I want us to explore new sounds and styles that will captivate our audience and make a statement.

Looking forward to your creativity!

Best,
