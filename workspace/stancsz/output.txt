Hey team!

I’m excited to brainstorm some new lyrics for our upcoming track! Let's dive into some fresh ideas that resonate with the Gen Z crowd. Here’s a lyric idea to kick things off, inspired by alternative R&B vibes:

**Verse Idea:**
(English)
"We're dancing in the shadows, chasing neon dreams,  
Caught in the rhythm of a heartbeat's scream.  
Lost in the moment, let the world fade away,  
Together we ignite, make the night our own play."

**Chorus Idea:**
(Japanese)
"夜空に星を重ねて（Yozora ni hoshi o kasanete）  
君と一緒に輝く（Kimi to issho ni kagayaku）  
未来を描くラブソング（Mirai o egaku rabusongu）  
この愛で溢れてく（Kono ai de afureteku）"

I want everyone to contribute their own unique ideas and styles—break out of the box and let’s experiment with sounds that speak to the younger generation! Remember, it’s all about innovation and connecting with our audience. 

Can’t wait to see what you all come up with! Let’s make something amazing together!

Best,  
Stan
