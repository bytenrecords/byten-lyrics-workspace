Hey team!

I hope you're all energized and ready to create some magic! Let's dive into this new track idea. For our theme, I'm thinking of capturing that feeling of youthful exploration and chasing dreams, mixing both vulnerability and confidence. 

Here's a lyric idea to kick us off:

**Verse Idea (English):**
When the sun sets low, I feel the rush,  
Chasing shadows, let me lose that hush.  
In a world of noise, we’ll write our song,  
With every heartbeat, we’ll prove them wrong.

**Chorus Idea (Chinese):**  
追梦的我 不怕风雨 (Chasing dreams, I fear no storm)  
在这旅途里 一起前行 (On this journey, we walk together)  
星光指引着我们往前走 (Starlight guides us, we move ahead)  
在每个节拍中 找到自己 (In every beat, we'll find ourselves).

Feel free to tweak these or come up with your own variations! I want us to explore that alternative R&B sound while resonating with the Gen Z audience. Think innovative rhythms, catchy melodies, and relatable themes!

Let’s get creative and see what we can brew up together. I’m excited to hear your ideas!

Best,
