Sure! Here’s a lyric idea to get us started, leaning into that alternative R&B vibe:

**(English)**  
**Chorus:**  
Lost in the city lights, we’ll chase the stars,  
A heartbeat away, no matter how far,  
In a world that whispers, we'll sing out loud,  
Together we rise, we’re the bold and the proud.  

**Verse:**  
Silhouettes in the twilight, dancing for dreams,  
Caught up in the moment, nothing’s as it seems,  
Swipe right on our fate, let’s rewrite the rules,  
With every step forward, we’re breaking their tools.

Let’s take inspiration from modern sounds, blend in some urban beats, and keep the flow catchy and relatable. I’m excited to see what everyone else can bring to this project! Who’s next?
