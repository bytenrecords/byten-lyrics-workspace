Subject: Let's Create Something Fresh!

Hey team!

I’m excited to dive into this new track creation! Let’s channel our creativity and craft some lyrics that resonate with the Gen Z vibe while embracing that alternative R&B sound. Here’s a lyric idea to get the ball rolling:

**Verse Idea (English):**
"In a world that feels so loud,  
I find peace in your silence.  
Storms may rage, we’ll stand our ground,  
Dancing in this state of defiance."

Feel free to switch it up or add your flair, and don't hesitate to bring in lyrics in Chinese or Japanese too! Let’s reflect the modern world and the emotions our audience feels. I want us to push boundaries and explore new styles together. 

Looking forward to your ideas! Let’s make some magic happen.

Best,
