Subject: New Track Brainstorming Session!

Hey team!

I hope you're all doing great! It's time to gather our creative forces and work on something exciting. I’m calling for fresh lyric ideas for our new track—aiming for that alternative R&B vibe that resonates with the Gen Z crowd.

Here’s my lyric idea to kick things off:

**Chorus Idea (in English):**
"Lost in the neon lights, we dance through the night,  
Chasing dreams too bright, we’ll hold on tight.  
In this city that never sleeps, let’s make memories,  
With you by my side, it’s a wild ride."

Now, let’s let our imaginations run wild! Feel free to contribute in Chinese, Japanese, or English—whatever feels right. I want us to explore fresh, modern styles that capture the energy and spirit of today’s youth.

Share your thoughts and ideas—let’s make some magic together!

Best,  
Stan
