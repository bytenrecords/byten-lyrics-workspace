Hey team!

I’m excited to get the creative juices flowing! Let’s dive into this new track and play with some fresh lyric ideas. Here’s a suggestion to kick things off:

**Lyric Idea (in English):**  
**Verse 1:**  
In the city lights, where dreams ignite,  
We chase the stars, we’ll be alright.  
Got each other’s backs, through every fight,  
Let’s make some noise, bring our hearts to life.

**Chorus:**  
We’re the generation, breaking the mold,  
With every beat, watch our story unfold.  
Dancing on the edge, feeling so bold,  
Together we rise, let the future be told.

Feel free to riff off of this or bring in some elements from Chinese or Japanese culture to blend into the vibe. Let’s keep pushing for that alternative R&B feel that resonates with the Gen Z crowd. I can’t wait to see what you all come up with!

Best,  
Stan
