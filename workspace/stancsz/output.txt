**Subject: New Track Development - Let's Get Creative!**

Hey team!

I hope you’re all ready to dive into some fresh sounds! I want us to work on a new track that resonates with the Gen Z crowd while incorporating an alternative R&B vibe. Let’s push our creative limits and explore modern styles that really stand out.

Here's an idea to get us started with lyrics in English:

**Chorus Idea:**
"Under neon lights we dance,  
Moments fleeting, take a chance,  
Hearts entwined like morning mist,  
Lost in dreams, we can't resist."

Feel free to take this and run with it! I’m encouraging everyone to also try writing lyrics in Chinese or Japanese. It’s all about innovation, so let’s mix languages, styles, and vibes.

Let’s brainstorm together and see where this takes us. I’m excited to hear your ideas!

Best,
