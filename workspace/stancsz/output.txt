Subject: Let's Get Creative with Our Next Track!

Hey team!

I hope you’re all doing well! I’m excited to kick off our new project and I want us to dive deep into creating a fresh track that resonates with the Gen Z crowd. I envision something that captures an alternative R&B vibe—something current, relatable, and innovative.

To get the ball rolling, I’d like to propose a lyrical idea that reflects the journey of self-discovery and empowerment. Imagine a narrative that flows through various cultures, represented through languages like Chinese, Japanese, and English. Here’s a starting point for the lyrics:

**Verse 1 (English):**
"In the mirror, I see my soul,  
Chasing dreams that make me whole.  
Every heartbeat, a brand-new start,  
With every note, I’m revealing my heart."

**Chorus (Chinese):**
"追逐梦想，不怕跌倒，  
每一步都让我更高。  
我在这旋律中自由飞翔,  
用心去感受，就会找到方向."

**Verse 2 (Japanese):**
"自分を見つめ、夜空を飛ぶ,  
夢の羽根で全てが見える.  
新たな希望、今感じて,  
メロディの中、私を解き放つ."

I encourage everyone to take this idea and run with it. Try to incorporate modern styles, play with rhythm and beats that appeal to a younger audience. Let’s push our boundaries and see where this takes us!

I’m looking forward to hearing your own ideas and additions. Let’s make something that stands out and really connects with listeners.

Best,
