Subject: Let's Create Something Awesome!

Hey team!

I hope you're all ready to dive into some creative vibes today. I want us to brainstorm a fresh track that resonates with the Gen Z audience. Let's channel that alternative R&B energy and create something that stands out.

Here's a lyric idea to get our wheels turning:

**Verse Idea (English):**
"Underneath the city lights, we chase our dreams,  
With every heartbeat, we're unraveling the seams,  
Lost in the rhythm, where our voices collide,  
Together we'll create a world where we can thrive."

Feel free to tweak it, add your own flavor, and explore different languages! I encourage you all to write in Chinese or Japanese as well, let’s make this project a true fusion of sounds and cultures.

Let’s push the boundaries and create an anthem that speaks to the hearts of young listeners. Can't wait to see what you all come up with!

Cheers,
