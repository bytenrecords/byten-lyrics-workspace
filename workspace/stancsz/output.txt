Hey team! ðŸŽ¶

Iâ€™m really excited about the potential for us to create something fresh and innovative. Letâ€™s dive into the alternative R&B vibe that resonates with our Gen Z audience.

**Lyric Idea:**

(English)
*Verse:*
In this city where the lights fade,  
We find solace in the midnight parade.  
Chasing dreams on the rooftop high,  
Weâ€™re the stars, no need to comply.

*Chorus:*  
Hands up, here we glow,  
In this moment, weâ€™ll let it flow.  
Let the rhythm take us there,  
A new world, no need to share.

Feel free to add your flair, whether in Chinese, Japanese, or English. Remember, letâ€™s keep the energy high and the ideas flowing! I canâ€™t wait to see what you all come up with.

Best,  
Stan
