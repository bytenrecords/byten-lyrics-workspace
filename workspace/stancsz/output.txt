Hey team! 

I’m excited to hear your creative ideas for our new track! Let’s push the boundaries and explore different languages and styles. Here’s a lyric idea to get things rolling:

**Verse Idea (English):**  
"In the neon glow, we dance through the night,  
Chasing dreams like shadows, feeling so light.  
Voices in the crowd whispering 'let's go,'  
We are the fire, we’re stealing the show."

Feel free to take inspiration from this or spin it in Chinese or Japanese! Let’s really capture that alternative R&B vibe that speaks to Gen Z. Don’t hold back—be bold, be innovative, and let’s make something unforgettable!

Looking forward to your ideas!

Best,  
Stan Chen
