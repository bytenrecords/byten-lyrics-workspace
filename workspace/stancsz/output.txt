Subject: New Track Ideas!

Hey team!

I’m excited about where we can go with our next track—let’s make something that resonates with the Gen Z crowd! I'm thinking of an alternative R&B vibe that is fresh and innovative. 

Here’s a lyric idea to get us started:

**Verse 1**:
In the city lights, I find my dream,  
Chasing echoes of your voice, it feels like a movie scene.  
Words like whispers, they float in the air,  
Connecting our souls, no one else can compare.

**Chorus**:  
Let’s dance through the night, no worries in sight,  
You and me together, everything feels right.  
With every heartbeat, we’ll make our stand,  
In this world of chaos, just take my hand.

Feel free to build on this or add your own lines. I encourage you all to dig deep into the modern styles that speak to our audience. Let’s see where our creativity takes us!

Looking forward to your ideas! 

Best,
