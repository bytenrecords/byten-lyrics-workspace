Subject: Let's Get Creative with a New Track!

Hey team!

I hope you’re all doing well. It’s time for us to push our creative boundaries and whip up something exciting together! I want us to explore some fresh lyrical ideas that resonate with the Gen Z vibe, ideally in alternative R&B style.

Here’s a lyric idea to get the ball rolling:

**Verse 1 (English):**
"In the city lights, where dreams collide,  
Whispers of tomorrow, let’s ride the tide.  
Chasing shadows, hearts intertwined,  
In a world of chaos, love’s our guide."

**Chorus (Chinese):**
"在这个城市的光影中,  
梦想与现实相遇你我不再孤单.  
心灵相连, 未来一起走,  
在迷乱中, 只要有爱就够."

I encourage everyone to jump in with your own lyric ideas—feel free to mix languages or styles! Let’s stir up some modern sounds that can really resonate with our audience. A bold blend of cultures and genres might be just what we need!

Looking forward to seeing what you all come up with!

Best,
