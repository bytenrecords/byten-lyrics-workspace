Hey team!

I’m excited about the potential here! Let’s dive into crafting something unique and contemporary that resonates with the Gen Z crowd. How about we explore a theme of self-identity and connection, drawing on the complexities of modern relationships? 

Here’s a lyric idea to kick things off:

**Chorus Idea (in English):**
“In the neon glow, we find our way,  
Lost in the rhythm, night turns to day.  
Heartbeats sync to the sound of the street,  
We’re chasing dreams where the real and the fake meet.”

I encourage everyone to play around with this concept—feel free to tweak these lines, or write your own verses in Chinese, Japanese, or English. Let’s aim for fresh harmonies and modern beats that really encapsulate that alternative R&B vibe!

Can’t wait to see what everyone comes up with! Keep pushing those creative boundaries!

Best,  
Stan
