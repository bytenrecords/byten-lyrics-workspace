Subject: Let's Create Something Fresh!

Hey team!

I’m excited to dive into a new project together—let's create a track that resonates with the Gen Z crowd. I want to see your creativity flow, so don’t hold back. Whether in Chinese, Japanese, or English, propose some fresh lyric ideas that capture the essence of alternative R&B. 

Here's a lyric starter to get things going:

**Chorus Idea:**
"Underneath the neon skies, we chase our dreams, never compromise. In this hyper-speed, we find our beat, together we rise."

Feel free to build on that or go in a completely different direction. I’m counting on you all to bring innovation and boldness to the table. Let’s push the boundaries and craft something that truly connects!

Looking forward to your ideas!

Best,
Stan Chen
