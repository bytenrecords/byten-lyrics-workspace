Hey team!

I'm really excited to dive into this new track. Let's push our creative boundaries and come up with something special that resonates with the Gen Z audience. I want to propose a concept for our lyrics centered around the theme of self-discovery and empowerment. Here’s a lyric idea to get the ball rolling:

**Chorus Idea:**
"Lost in the city lights, finding my way,  
With every heartbeat, I’m here to stay.  
Whispers of dreams, I’m breaking the mold,  
This is my story, watch it unfold."

Feel free to build on this, modify it, or even approach it from different angles. Remember, we have the freedom to experiment with the sound—let’s make this alternative R&B track something that really stands out! 

Now, who’s got some fresh ideas or different lyrical angles we can explore? Let’s collaborate and make something incredible!

Best,  
Stan
