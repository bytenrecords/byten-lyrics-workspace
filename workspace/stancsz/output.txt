Hey team!

I hope everyone is feeling inspired today because we’re diving into a new track! I'd like us to explore some fresh lyric ideas that resonate with the Gen Z vibe—think alternative R&B melodies with dynamic beats. 

Here’s a starting lyric idea to get the ball rolling:

**Chorus Idea (English):**
*"Chasing the sunset, we dance on the edge,  
Lost in the moment, no need for a pledge.  
These nights feel electric, hearts in sync,  
We’re writing our story, just let it all ink."*

Feel free to tweak this or go in your own direction. If you’re inspired to write in Chinese or Japanese, don’t hold back! Let’s make sure we push boundaries and experiment with different sounds and styles. 

I’m excited to see what everyone comes up with! Hit me with your best ideas, and let’s create something that really resonates!

Best,  
Stan
