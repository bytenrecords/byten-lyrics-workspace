Subject: New Song Development - Creative Lyric Ideas Required

Hi Team,

I hope this message finds you well! As we continue to expand our musical repertoire at Byten Records, I’m reaching out to get your creative minds working on developing new song lyrics.

### Here’s what I’d like you to do:

1. **Lyric Development**: 
   - I’d like each of you to brainstorm ideas for song lyrics. 
   - We are specifically looking to create songs in **Chinese, Japanese, or English**, so please consider these languages as you develop your ideas.

2. **New Styles Exploration**: 
   - We’re also aiming to explore **new styles** of music that would resonate with today’s audience, particularly styles like **Alternative RnB**. 
   - Think Gen Z friendly themes and sounds - let’s innovate and keep our music relevant!

3. **Collaboration**: 
   - Feel free to collaborate with one another and share your ideas. 
   - We want to ensure that the lyrics not only tell a story but also connect with listeners on an emotional level.

Please send your initial ideas and drafts by **[insert deadline date]**, so we can review and discuss them further in our next meeting.

Looking forward to seeing your creative genius at work!

Best,  
Stan Chen
