Subject: Let's Cook Up Some Fresh Tracks!

Hey Team!

Hope you’re all ready to dive into some creative vibes! I want us to brainstorm and whip up a new track that has that modern, alternative R&B feel, perfect for connecting with the Gen Z crowd. Let's make it fresh, innovative, and something that really resonates.

Here’s an idea to get the ball rolling: 

**Verse Idea (in English):**
"Chasing dreams in neon lights,  
In a world that feels so right,  
We dance to the rhythm of the night,  
Hearts in sync, taking flight..."

Feel free to play around with this concept and twist it in your own ways. And remember, you can write lyrics in Chinese or Japanese too! Let’s keep the energy high, and I encourage you all to try out new styles, sounds, and lyrical themes. 

Excited to see what you all come up with—let’s make something that truly connects with our audience!

Best,  
Stan
