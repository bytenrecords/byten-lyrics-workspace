Hey team!

I hope everyone is doing well! I’m really excited about the possibility of creating something fresh and innovative together. Let’s focus on finding that alternative R&B vibe that resonates with Gen Z. Here’s a lyric idea to kick things off:

**English Lyric Idea:**
"Chasing dreams through neon lights,  
We’ll paint the night with our fire,  
Heartbeats sync with city vibes,  
Let’s write our story, take it higher."

Feel free to build on this, twist it, or even take a completely different route in your own languages—be it Chinese or Japanese! Remember, we want something that makes an impact and feels relatable. 

Let’s dive into those explorations and see what magic we can create. Looking forward to your ideas!

Best,  
Stan Chen
