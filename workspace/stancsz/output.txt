Subject: Let's Create Something Fresh!

Hey team!

I hope you’re all ready to dive into an exciting project! I want us to cook up a new track that really resonates with our Gen Z audience and pushes the boundaries. Let's aim for that fresh alternative R&B vibe that combines catchy melodies with thought-provoking lyrics.

Here’s a lyric idea to get us started:

**Verse Idea (English):**
"In a world of echoes, I’m searching for the light,  
With every heartbeat, we’ll rise, we’ll ignite.  
Chasing dreams on a midnight drive,  
Together we’ll find what it means to be alive."

Feel free to tweak it or build on it, and remember, you can write in Chinese or Japanese too! Let’s keep our minds open and explore modern styles that break the mold. I’m counting on everyone’s creativity to spark something amazing!

Looking forward to your inputs!

Best,
