Subject: Let’s Get Creative!

Hey Team!

I'm excited to kick off our next project. I want us to dive into the creation of a new track that resonates with our Gen Z audience. Let’s aim for that alternative R&B vibe—something fresh and innovative that really speaks to them.

To get the ball rolling, here’s a lyric idea I came up with:

**Verse Idea (English):**
“Fading lights and restless nights,  
Chasing dreams in city sights,  
Heartbeats sync to the bass,  
In this world, we find our place.”

Feel free to build on this or propose your own ideas! Don’t hesitate to use Chinese or Japanese lyrics too; I want us to explore all avenues. Let’s be bold and push for something that stands out.

I’m looking forward to seeing what you all come up with. Let’s make some magic happen!

Best,  
Stan
