Hey team!

I’m excited to dive deeper into this project and get those creative juices flowing. I've been thinking about capturing that fresh vibe that resonates with Gen Z while incorporating some modern styles that are all the rage right now. Here’s a fresh lyric idea that ties into themes of self-identity and the complexities of navigating life:

**[Verse 1]**  
Waves of neon colors, in this city we roam,  
Each heartbeat echoing, like we’re never alone.  
Scrolling through moments, chasing vibes so real,  
Can we just pause, breathe, let our souls feel?  

**[Chorus]**  
Let’s turn back time, to when we felt alive,  
When laughter was the language, and dreams were our drive.  
Let the music guide us, through the highs and lows,  
We’re the architects of dreams, let our story unfold.

Let’s infuse some alternative R&B aesthetics with smooth beats and airy synths. I encourage everyone to contribute their thoughts, whether it’s melody ideas, production styles, or even different languages—don't hold back!

Let’s create something that really speaks to our generation! Looking forward to everyone's input!

Best,
