Subject: Let's Get Creative with a New Track!

Hey team!

I’m buzzing with excitement to cook up something fresh for our next project! I want us to really dive into that alternative R&B vibe that’s resonating with the Gen Z crowd. Let’s get innovative and push our creative boundaries.

Here’s a lyric idea to spark some inspiration:

**Chorus Idea (English):**
"In the glow of neon lights, we chase our dreams,  
Every heartbeat's a rhythm, tearing at the seams.  
Whispers in the shadows, secrets to unfold,  
We’re the stories written, young and bold."

Feel free to play around with this, or even translate it into Chinese or Japanese if you feel it fits better! Incorporate modern sounds, rhythms, or any unique elements you think would stand out. 

Let’s share our ideas and keep the momentum going—can’t wait to hear what everyone brings to the table!

Best,
