### Instructions for the Team  

- **Song Language:** We will focus on crafting songs in **Chinese**, **Japanese**, and **English** to broaden our global appeal.  
- **Collaboration Deadline:** All drafts should be submitted by **next Friday** for a comprehensive team review. I will provide feedback and suggestions afterward.  
- **Lyric Themes:** Center the lyrics around concepts that resonate with Gen Z, highlighting values like authenticity, empowerment, and cultural awareness.  
- **Genre Experimentation:** Feel free to explore innovative fusions within modern genres, such as **alternative R&B**, **lo-fi chill**, and **synthwave** infused with traditional sounds.
