Subject: Let's Get Creative with a New Track!

Hey team!

I’m excited to dive into our next project and I can’t wait to see what we can come up with together! For our new track, I’d love to see us blend elements of alternative R&B with something that resonates with Gen Z. Let’s aim for fresh perspectives and modern vibes that are sure to capture attention.

As for lyrics, here’s an idea to get the ball rolling:

---

**Verse Idea (English):**  
In the city lights, where dreams ignite,  
We’re chasing shadows, through the endless night.  
Heartbeats sync to the rhythm we create,  
Lost in the moment, let’s not hesitate.

**Chorus Idea (Chinese):**  
我们在星空下舞动 (Wǒmen zài xīngkōng xià wǔdòng)  
自由感受每一次心跳 (Zìyóu gǎnshòu měi yīcì xīntiào)  
不再害怕，我们一起 (Bù zài hàipà, wǒmen yīqǐ)  
在这旋律里找到自己 (Zài zhè xuànlǜ lǐ zhǎodào zìjǐ)

Feel free to take these lines and tweak them, or inspire something entirely different! Let’s keep that energy going and think out of the box! I want to see your creativity shine, so don’t hold back. 

Looking forward to your thoughts and ideas!

Best,
