Hey team!

I’m excited to dive into this creative session! How about we explore some lyrics that delve into themes of self-discovery and empowerment, which really resonate with the Gen Z crowd? Here’s a rough idea to spark our inspiration. 

**Lyric Idea:**

*Verse 1 (English):*  
I’m finding my way, in a world that’s so loud,  
Chasing my dreams, never backing down,  
Colors collide, and I’m painting my fate,  
With every heartbeat, I’m learning to create.

*Chorus (Japanese):*  
自分を見つけて、  
夢に向かって走っていく,  
この瞬間を楽しんで、  
自由に踊ろう,  

*Verse 2 (Chinese):*  
在每一個轉角，我聽見心跳,  
不怕失敗，勇敢擁抱，  
我在風中找到自己的旋律,  
一起歌唱，跟隨心的指引。  

Let’s not be afraid to take risks and blend each culture’s unique sounds into our track. Look forward to hearing your ideas and how we can build on this!

Best,  
Stan
