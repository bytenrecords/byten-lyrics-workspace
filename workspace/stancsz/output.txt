**Subject: New Track Project: Alternative R&B Vibes!**

Hey team!

I hope everyone is pumped for our next creative session! I’m looking to cook up a fresh track that resonates with the Gen Z crowd, and I know we can make something special together. Let's focus on an alternative R&B vibe—something that feels innovative and relatable.

Here's a lyric idea to kick us off: 

**(English)**  
*"When the city lights flicker, we dance in the rain,  
Lost in the moment, we shed all the pain.  
Hearts beating faster, like sparks in the night,  
Together we rise, under neon lights."*

I encourage you to explore lyrics in Chinese or Japanese as well! Let’s see how we can blend these languages into our sound. Remember, the goal is to create a track that feels fresh and modern—let’s not hold back on our creativity!

Looking forward to your ideas and contributions. Let’s make magic happen!

Best,
