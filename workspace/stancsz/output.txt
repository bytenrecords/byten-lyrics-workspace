Hey team!

I hope everyone is doing great! I’m excited to dive into our creative process and cook up something new. Let’s brainstorm some fresh lyric ideas for our next track! 

Here’s a suggestion to get the ball rolling:

**Lyric Idea in English:**
*“In a world lit by screens, we chase the neon dreams, don’t stop till we’re found, breaking borders, making sounds.”*

This can evoke that sense of digital connection mixed with the struggle for authenticity—perfect for our Gen Z audience. 

Remember, feel free to bring in lyrics in Chinese, Japanese, or your preferred language! Let’s keep the vibe alternative R&B and push the boundaries with modern sounds that resonate. 

Can’t wait to hear your ideas!

Best,
Stan Chen
