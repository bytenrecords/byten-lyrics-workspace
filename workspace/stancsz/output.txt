Hey team! I’m excited about the opportunity to craft something fresh and innovative together. Let’s focus on creating a track that embodies the alternative R&B vibe we’re aiming for. Here’s a lyric idea to kick things off:

**(Verse 1)**  
In the neon glow, where shadows dance,  
We find our truth in a restless trance.  
Whispers of dreams, like waves we ride,  
With every heartbeat, the world’s on our side.

**(Chorus)**  
Feel the rhythm of the city pulse,  
Chasing stars, we’ll never resist.  
Echoes of youth in the night we trust,  
Together we rise, it’s a must.

I encourage you all to think outside the box! Let’s blend cultures and styles—whether it's in Chinese, Japanese, or English. What do you think? Let’s get those ideas flowing and create something that resonates with the Gen Z crowd! Looking forward to your contributions. 

Best,  
Stan
