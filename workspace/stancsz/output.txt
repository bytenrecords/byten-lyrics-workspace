Hey team!

I hope you're all ready to brainstorm some exciting new ideas. I want each of you to dive into some fresh creative waters. Let's focus on crafting lyrics that resonate with the Gen Z audience while maintaining that alternative R&B vibe that we’re aiming for.

Here’s a lyric idea to kick things off:

**Verse Idea:**
"In a city that never sleeps, we’re chasing dreams,  
With neon lights and midnight schemes.  
Lost in a world that moves so fast,  
But our connection, oh, it’s built to last."

I encourage you all to take inspiration from this and experiment with your own unique styles! Don’t hesitate to throw in some lines in Chinese or Japanese if they're flowing well for you—it could really set us apart!

Let’s push those creative boundaries! Looking forward to seeing your ideas; let’s make something that truly grabs the Gen Z crowd. 

Cheers,
Stan
