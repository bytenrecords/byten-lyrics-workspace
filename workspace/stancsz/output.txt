Subject: Let's Create Something Fresh!

Hey team!

I'm excited to kickstart our next creative session! I want us to explore new lyrical ideas that are vibrant and resonate with the Gen Z audience. Think alternative R&B—something that feels fresh and powerful.

Here's a lyric idea to get the ball rolling:

---

**Verse:**
在这个混乱的城市, 我们追逐梦,  
眼中闪烁着希望, 不怕风雨来袭。  
跟着节奏舞动, 放飞所有的情绪,  
这是属于我们的时代, 不用隐身不需妥协。

**Chorus:**  
跟我走, 在夜空下,  
每一个音符都在呼喊。  
真实的自我, 摆脱束缚,  
与世无争, 只为梦想飞翔。

Feel free to tweak this and let your creativity run wild! I want to see more ideas—whether they’re in Chinese, Japanese, or English. Let’s explore layers of sound and lyrics that challenge the norm and catch the ear of our audience.

Looking forward to what you all come up with!

Best,
