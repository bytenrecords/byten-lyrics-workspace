Hey team! 

I’ve been thinking a lot about capturing that fresh vibe that resonates with Gen Z, especially within the alternative R&B scene. How about we play around with the concept of finding self-identity and navigating life’s uncertainties? Here’s a lyric idea to kick things off:

---

**Verse 1:**  
Lost in the city lights, chasing dreams,  
Got my heart on my sleeve, bursting at the seams.  
Filters and facades, they’re weighing me down,  
Scrolling through memories, where’s my crown?  

**Chorus:**  
Can we just rewind, to the moments we’d find  
When the world wasn’t heavy, felt the rhythm unwind?  
Let the echoes of laughter lift us tonight,  
We’re the stars of our story, ready to ignite.

Let’s layer in some smooth beats and electronic elements to keep it contemporary. I’d love to hear your thoughts and see where we can take this! Send over your ideas, whether it’s melody suggestions, production styles, or even alternative lyrics!

Looking forward to creating something amazing together!

Best,
