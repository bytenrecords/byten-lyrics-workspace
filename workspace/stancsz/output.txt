Subject: Let’s Create Something Fresh!

Hey team!

I hope you’re all ready to dive into some creative vibes this week! I want us to cook up a new track that resonates with the Gen Z crowd, something that captures that alternative R&B feel. Here’s an idea to get us started:

**Lyric Idea:**

*Verse 1:*
In the city lights, we dance alone,  
Chasing dreams with hearts of chrome.  
Lost in the rhythm, we feel the flow,  
Living for the moment, don’t wanna go slow.

*Chorus:*  
Let’s break the mold, rewrite the song,  
In this world of chaos, we still belong.  
With every heartbeat, let the music collide,  
Together we rise, no need to hide.

Feel free to build on this or come up with your own lyrics. Remember, you can write in Chinese, Japanese, or English—whatever sparks your creativity! 

Let’s experiment with modern sounds and create something that stands out. I’m looking forward to seeing what you all come up with!

Cheers,
