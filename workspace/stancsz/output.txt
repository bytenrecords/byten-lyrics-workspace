Subject: New Song Creation Project

Hi Team,

I hope this message finds you well! I am excited to announce that we are kicking off a new project to create fresh lyrics and songs. Here’s what I need from all of you:

1. **Lyrics Creation**: Please brainstorm and come up with ideas for new lyrics. We are particularly focusing on creating songs in Chinese, Japanese, or English. I want to see a variety of themes, emotions, and stories that resonate with our audience.

2. **New Styles Exploration**: Let’s push our creative boundaries by experimenting with new styles, particularly in the realms of alternative R&B and music that appeals to Gen Z. Think about incorporating unique beats, melodies, and lyrics that reflect contemporary trends and cultural influences.

**Next Steps**:
- Set a deadline for your initial ideas and drafts by [insert deadline date].
- Collaborate with each other on feedback and sharing of inspiration.
- We’ll schedule a meeting to discuss our progress and share our ideas.

I’m looking forward to seeing what everyone comes up with! Let’s create something amazing together.

Best,
Stan Chen
