Hey team!

I’m excited about the potential for our new track! Let’s aim for something that resonates with the Gen Z crowd while pushing the boundaries of alternative R&B. Here’s a lyric idea to kick us off:

---

**Verse Idea (English):**
In the neon lights, we’ve lost our way,  
Chasing shadows, in the night we play,  
Heartbeat syncs to the city’s pulse,  
In this moment, we’re invincible.

**Chorus Idea (Chinese):**
迷失在霓虹灯下，  
追逐沉默的节拍，  
这一刻，让我们一起飞，  
无畏未来，心之所向。

---

Let’s take these elements—we can mix it up, play with the melody, and add some fresh instrumentation. I encourage everyone to share their ideas, whether that’s new lyrics, chorus variations, or even instrumental suggestions. Remember, the goal is to produce something modern and relatable. Your creativity is what makes us shine!

Looking forward to seeing what you all come up with!

Best,  
Stan
