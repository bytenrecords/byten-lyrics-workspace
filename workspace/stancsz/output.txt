Hey team! 

We're diving into something special today. I want us to create a fresh track that resonates with the Gen Z crowd, perhaps in that alternative R&B vibe. Let’s capture their feelings, their struggles, and their dreams in a way that feels authentic and engaging.

**Lyric Idea:**

在微光中找回自我,    
用心跳去描繪每個夢,    
我們在這個城市的喧囂中,    
緊握希望，讓音樂帶我們飛行。    

這段旋律輕輕流轉,    
每一個心跳都在唱,    
不向世界妥協,    
自由是我們的信仰。    

**Feel free to build upon this, add your own styles or twist, and let’s see what we can create together.** Let’s keep exploring modern sounds and experiment with fresh melodies. 

Looking forward to your ideas! 

Best,
Stan Chen
