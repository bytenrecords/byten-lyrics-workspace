Sure, let’s get cooking on some fresh lyrics with an alternative R&B vibe! 

**Lyric Idea: (In English)**

**Verse 1:**  
Late nights, street lights, we dance ‘til the dawn,  
Electric hearts beat, in a world we belong,  
Whispers in the shadows, secrets in our skin,  
Underneath the moonlight, let the chaos begin.  

**Chorus:**  
Can you feel the rhythm in our bones?  
A melody of freedom, breaking down the stones,  
We're young and wild, chasing dreams in the dark,  
In this alternative world, it’s the love that leaves a mark.  

**Verse 2:**  
Scrolling through the moments, lost in the screen,  
Building up the memories of all that we’ve seen,  
A vibe that’s contagious, like fire in the rain,  
Every little heartbeat, echoes joy and pain.  

**Chorus:**  
Can you feel the rhythm in our bones?  
A melody of freedom, breaking down the stones,  
We're young and wild, chasing dreams in the dark,  
In this alternative world, it’s the love that leaves a mark.
