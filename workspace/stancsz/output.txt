Subject: Let's Create Some Fresh Lyrics!

Hey team!

I hope you are all charged up for our next project! I want to kick things off with a collaboration surrounding a new track that blends alternative R&B with vibes that resonate with our Gen Z audience. Let’s innovate and really push the envelope!

Here's a lyric idea to get those creative juices flowing:

**Verse Concept:**
- English: “In a city of lights, can you feel the pulse? Chasing dreams in silence, we stop and we rush. Hearts beat like the bass, let’s break every rule, together we’ll find a way to rewrite the school.”

Feel free to translate this into Chinese or Japanese if you'd like, or use this as a springboard for your own ideas! Let's explore different themes around youth, freedom, and self-discovery. 

Remember, don’t hold back on experimenting with styles and sounds! We want this to be something fresh that truly connects. I’m excited to see what you all come up with!

Best,
Stan Chen
