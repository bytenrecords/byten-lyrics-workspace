Hey team!

I hope everyone is ready to get creative! Let’s dive into crafting some new lyrics for our upcoming track. I’m envisioning a modern alternative R&B vibe that resonates with the Gen Z audience. 

Here’s a lyric idea to kick things off:

**Verse 1 (English):**
“I chase the city lights, they reflect in my eyes,  
With every heartbeat, I’m breaking the lies,  
Lost in the moment, but I’m finding my way,  
Dancing through shadows, I’m ready to play.”

Feel free to expand on this, or throw in your own ideas! Don't hesitate to experiment with Chinese or Japanese lyrics—let's blend those styles and make something unique. Remember, think bold, think fresh!

Looking forward to what you all come up with!

Best,  
Stan
