Hey team!

I’m excited about the idea of creating a fresh track! Let’s push some boundaries. How about a verse that blends introspective feelings with a catchy groove? Here’s an initial idea for the lyrics, focusing on the journey of self-discovery, which resonates well with Gen Z:

**Verse Idea in English:**
"Chasing shadows, finding me in neon dreams,  
Lost in the sound, spilling truths at the seams.  
With every beat, I break away,  
In this rhythm, I’ll learn to stay."

Feel free to tweak, add to it, or bounce around similar vibes in Chinese or Japanese! Let’s explore those modern styles and see what we can create together. I encourage everyone to think of innovative sound palettes that could really capture attention. 

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and ideas!

Best,  
Stan
