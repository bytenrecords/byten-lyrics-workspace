Subject: Let's Create Some Fresh Lyrics! 🎶

Hey team!

I want to dive headfirst into creating a new track that resonates with our Gen Z audience. I’m envisioning an alternative R&B vibe—something fresh and bold that we can really elevate together.

Here’s a lyric idea to kickstart the brainstorming:

**Verse Idea (English):**  
*“In the neon light, we chase our dreams,  
Riding on rhythms, tearing at the seams.  
Our hearts beat loud, they can't control,  
Living for the moment, that’s how we roll.”*  

Feel free to play around with this and add your own flair! Whether it’s in Chinese, Japanese, or English, I want to see what unique styles and perspectives we can bring to the table. Let’s explore unconventional rhythms, captivating melodies, and lyrics that speak directly to the pulse of our generation.

Looking forward to hearing your ideas!

Best,  
Stan
