Subject: Let's Create Some Fresh Vibes!

Hey team!

I'm excited to kick off our next project and get those creative juices flowing! Let’s focus on an alternative R&B vibe that resonates with our Gen Z audience. 

Here’s a lyric idea to get us started:

**Verse 1 (English)**  
Lost in the city lights, we chase our dreams,  
Every heartbeat echoes, louder than it seems.  
With every step we take, we break the mold,  
Let the rhythm guide us, we’re brave and bold.

**Chorus (Chinese)**  
在繁星下，我们飞翔，  
心跳的节奏，永不放弃。  
未来是我们的，风在耳边唱，  
随音乐而舞，直到天亮。  

I encourage all of you to contribute your unique styles and perspectives. Whether it’s in English, Chinese, or Japanese, let's blend different influences to create something that really pops! Feel free to share your ideas, and let’s collaborate!

Looking forward to what you all come up with!

Best,
