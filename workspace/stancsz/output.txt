Hey team!

I’m excited to see what creative sparks we can ignite together. Let’s push the envelope with our sound for this new track. I’m envisioning a mix of contemporary themes that resonate with Gen Z, layered over an alternative R&B vibe.

Here’s a fresh lyric idea to get us started:

**Chorus Idea (English):**
"Lost in the rhythm, we find our way,  
Under the moonlight, we dance & sway.  
Voices echo, our dreams collide,  
In this moment, let the world slide."

Feel free to build on this, and I encourage you all to incorporate your unique cultural elements. Whether it’s a catchy phrase in Chinese or a poetic line in Japanese, let’s make this track something that speaks to the youth today! 

Looking forward to seeing your ideas—let’s make magic happen!

Best,  
Stan
