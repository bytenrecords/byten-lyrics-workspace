Subject: Let’s Create Something Fresh!

Hey team!

I hope you’re all ready to unleash those creative juices because I'm buzzing with excitement about our next track! I want us to lean into that alternative R&B vibe that resonates with the Gen Z crowd. 

Here’s a lyric idea to get us started:

**Verse:**
In the city lights, we glow,  
Chasing dreams that ebb and flow,  
Heartbeats sync to rhythm's pulse,  
Let’s break the mold, let’s not repulse.  

**Chorus:**  
We’re young and wild, no limits in sight,  
With every step, we spark the night.  
Feel the bass, let it take control,  
In this moment, we're bold and whole.

Feel free to take this and run with it, or remix it in any language you want—Chinese, Japanese, or English works! Let’s play with words and see how we can modernize it further. Don’t hesitate to push those boundaries; innovation is key! 

Can’t wait to hear your ideas!

Best,
