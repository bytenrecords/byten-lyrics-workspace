**Track Title:** "Midnight Drive"

**[Intro] [Instrumental]**  
(Imagine a soft synth ambient build-up that sets the mood...)

**[Verse 1]**  
"In a world of echoes, I’m searching for the light,  
With every heartbeat, we’ll rise, we’ll ignite.  
Chasing dreams on a midnight drive,  
Together we’ll find what it means to be alive."

**[Chorus]**  
"Let go of the fear, let the stars be our map,  
In this fearless moment, we’ll bridge every gap.  
Ride the rhythm of love, through the highs and the lows,  
In the glow of the streetlights, let our true colors show."

**[Hook]**  
“Let’s fly, let’s soar, through the endless night,  
With you by my side, everything feels right.”  

**[Verse 2]**  
“Whispers of the city, they call out to me,  
Telling tales of wanderers, longing to be free.  
With an open heart, we’ll paint the sky,  
In this vibrant world, we’ll learn how to fly.”

**[Chorus]**  
"Let go of the fear, let the stars be our map,  
In this fearless moment, we’ll bridge every gap.  
Ride the rhythm of love, through the highs and the lows,  
In the glow of the streetlights, let our true colors show."

**[Bridge]**  
"Every twist and turn, every bump in the road,  
We’ll dance through the chaos, won’t ever feel alone.  
With our spirits ignited, we’re breaking the mold,  
In this journey together, our story unfolds."
