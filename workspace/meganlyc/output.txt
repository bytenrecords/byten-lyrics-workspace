**Title:** "Midnight Parade"

**Lyric Idea:**

*[Intro] [Instrumental]*  
*(Uplifting synths with a catchy beat)*

*Verse 1:*  
In this city where the lights fade,  
We find solace in the midnight parade.  
Chasing dreams on the rooftop high,  
Weâ€™re the stars, no need to comply.

*Chorus:*  
Hands up, here we glow,  
In this moment, weâ€™ll let it flow.  
Let the rhythm take us there,  
A new world, no need to share.

*Verse 2:*  
Underneath the neon sky,  
We dance in circles, you and I.  
Feel that magic, breathe it in,  
In this heartbeat, letâ€™s begin.

*Chorus:*  
Hands up, here we glow,  
In this moment, weâ€™ll let it flow.  
Let the rhythm take us there,  
A new world, no need to share.

*Hook:*  
Oh-oh, letâ€™s ride this wave,  
With every step, we feel so brave.  
Together we're unstoppable tonight,  
In this midnight parade, we shine so bright.

*[Outro] [Instrumental]*  
*(Fade out with shimmering synths and echoing vocals)*
