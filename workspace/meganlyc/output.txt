**Title: "Neon Dreams"**

**[Intro] [Instrumental]**

**[Verse 1]**  
Running wild down these city streets,  
Where our laughter echoes, dancing to the beats.  
Every moment's electric, a snapshot in time,  
Weâ€™re writing our own story, in rhythm and rhyme.

**[Chorus]**  
In the glow of neon lights, we chase our dreams,  
Every heartbeat's a rhythm, tearing at the seams.  
Whispers in the shadows, secrets to unfold,  
Weâ€™re the stories written, young and bold.

**[Hook]**  
Oh, let the night take us higher,  
With every spark, we light the fire.  
Living for the moment, breaking free,  
In our neon dreams, just you and me.

**[Verse 2]**  
Footsteps echo, the city's alive,  
With every shared glance, we feel the vibe.  
We're wanderers chasing the midnight glow,  
Lost in the music, no place else we'd go.

**[Chorus]**  
In the glow of neon lights, we chase our dreams,  
Every heartbeat's a rhythm, tearing at the seams.  
Whispers in the shadows, secrets to unfold,  
Weâ€™re the stories written, young and bold.

**[Bridge]**  
So let's paint the night with our smiles,  
Travel these streets, go endless miles.  
With each moment fleeting, let the magic stay,  
In the heartbeat of the city, weâ€™ll find our way.

**[Chorus]**  
In the glow of neon lights, we chase our dreams,  
Every heartbeat's a rhythm, tearing at the seams.  
Whispers in the shadows, secrets to unfold,  
Weâ€™re the stories written, young and bold.
