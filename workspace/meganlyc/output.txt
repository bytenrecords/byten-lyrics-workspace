**Status Update:**

I have reached out to the owner to request specific instructions for creating new song lyrics. I am patiently awaiting their response regarding the title, style of music, and any themes or concepts that should be reflected in the lyrics.

Once I receive the necessary guidance, I will begin drafting the lyrics promptly.

**Next Steps:**
- Await the owner's response.
- Upon receiving the details, I will create new song lyrics wrapped in sections as per the formatting requirements.
