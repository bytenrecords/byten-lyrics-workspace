**[Intro]**  
*Soft synths building up, gentle rhythm*  
Hey, hey, oh, oh  
Where do we go from here?

**[Verse 1]**  
Lost in the city lights, chasing dreams,  
Got my heart on my sleeve, bursting at the seams.  
Filters and facades, they’re weighing me down,  
Scrolling through memories, where’s my crown?  
*Let’s break free, no more pretense,*  
*Finding our truth, feels like a new sense.*  

---

**[Chorus]**  
Can we just rewind, to the moments we’d find  
When the world wasn’t heavy, felt the rhythm unwind?  
Let the echoes of laughter lift us tonight,  
We’re the stars of our story, ready to ignite.

**[Hook]**  
*Oh, we’re brighter than the stars,*  
*Let’s dance until we lose our scars.*  
*In this journey, we’ll find our way,*  
*With every heartbeat, it’s a brand new day.*

**[Verse 2]**  
Riding the highs, and feeling the lows,  
Navigating through life, where nobody knows.  
With the beat in our veins, we’ll rise above,  
Searching for purpose, fueled by love.

**[Chorus]**  
Can we just rewind, to the moments we’d find  
When the world wasn’t heavy, felt the rhythm unwind?  
Let the echoes of laughter lift us tonight,  
We’re the stars of our story, ready to ignite.

**[Outro]**  
*Fading out with soft beats and vocals*  
Tonight, we shine, oh we’re ready to soar,  
Together we’ll rise, forever wanting more.
