**Title: "Chasing Fireflies"**

**[intro] [instrumental]**  
(Playful strumming of acoustic guitar, light synth undertones)  

**[verse 1]**  
Underneath the moonlit glow,  
We dance where whispers flow,  
With stars above and hearts so free,  
This night is ours, you and me.  

**[chorus]**  
Oh, weâ€™re chasing fireflies,  
Dancing in the twilight skies,  
With dreams that sparkle in our eyes,  
Letâ€™s catch the magic, no goodbyes.  

**[hook]**  
So light up the dark, letâ€™s shine so bright,  
Together weâ€™ll set this world alight!  

**[verse 2]**  
Through meadows lush, we laugh and play,  
In our little universe, letâ€™s drift away,  
With every moment, with every song,  
In this adventure where we belong.  

**[chorus]**  
Oh, weâ€™re chasing fireflies,  
Dancing in the twilight skies,  
With dreams that sparkle in our eyes,  
Letâ€™s catch the magic, no goodbyes.  

**[hook]**  
So light up the dark, letâ€™s shine so bright,  
Together weâ€™ll set this world alight!  

**[outro] [instrumental]**
