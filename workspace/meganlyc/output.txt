**Title**: Echoes of Yesterday  

**[Intro] [Instrumental]**  

**[Verse 1]**  
When the sun sets low, shadows start to play,  
Whispers of the night call me to stay.  
In a world so vibrant, colors blend and sway,  
Chasing dreams together, we’ll find our way.  

**[Chorus]**  
Oh, we’re the story in the making,  
Hearts on fire, never breaking.  
With every beat, we’re resonating,  
In this moment, love’s awakening.  

**[Hook]**  
Let’s dance through the echoes of yesterday,  
With every step, we’ll break away.  

**[Verse 2]**  
Underneath the stars, secrets come alive,  
We’ll paint our future in the midnight sky.  
With your hand in mine, we’ll learn to fly,  
Boundless like the ocean, never asking why.  

**[Chorus]**  
Oh, we’re the story in the making,  
Hearts on fire, never breaking.  
With every beat, we’re resonating,  
In this moment, love’s awakening.  

**[Bridge]**  
So let the music take control,  
Feel the rhythm in your soul,  
We’re the fire, we’re the night,  
Together we’ll ignite the light.
