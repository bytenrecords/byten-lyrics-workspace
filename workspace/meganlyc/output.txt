**Title:** Radiant Youth

**[Intro] [Instrumental]**

**[Verse 1]:**  
In the city lights, we glow,  
Chasing dreams that ebb and flow,  
Heartbeats sync to rhythm's pulse,  
Letâ€™s break the mold, letâ€™s not repulse.

**[Chorus]:**  
Weâ€™re young and wild, no limits in sight,  
With every step, we spark the night.  
Feel the bass, let it take control,  
In this moment, we're bold and whole.

**[Hook]:**  
Oh, we're dancing through the chaos,  
Unfolding like a flower,  
Catching sparks, weâ€™re unstoppable,  
Our energy is power!

**[Verse 2]:**  
From rooftops high, weâ€™ll scream our truth,  
Living loud in our vibrant youth.  
Whispers of love in the neon glow,  
In this wild ride, let go, let go!

**[Chorus]:**  
Weâ€™re young and wild, no limits in sight,  
With every step, we spark the night.  
Feel the bass, let it take control,  
In this moment, we're bold and whole.

**[Bridge]:**  
So letâ€™s fly, letâ€™s rise above,  
Surrounded by stars and a world full of love.  
Weâ€™ll chart our own course, no need to conform,  
In this song of life, weâ€™ll dance in the storm.

**[Chorus]:**  
Weâ€™re young and wild, no limits in sight,  
With every step, we spark the night.  
Feel the bass, let it take control,  
In this moment, we're bold and whole.
