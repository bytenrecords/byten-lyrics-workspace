**Title: "Chasing Rainbows"**

**[Intro] [Instrumental]**  
*(Bright synths and playful ukulele strumming)*  

**[Verse 1]**  
In a world spun with color,  
I dance through dreams that hover.  
Every step a little magic,  
With a heart thatâ€™s untrapped, so fantastic!  

**[Chorus]**  
Chasing rainbows in the sky,  
Letâ€™s laugh, letâ€™s sing, let our spirits fly!  
With every note, we paint the air,  
Together, darling, weâ€™re a breath of flair!  

**[Hook]**  
Oh, oh, letâ€™s chase those beams of light,  
Weâ€™re the stars that sparkle so bright!  

**[Verse 2]**  
With friends beside, weâ€™ll paint the night,  
Adventures waiting, everything feels right.  
Inspiration flowing, like a river wide,  
With every moment, letâ€™s take a ride!  

**[Chorus]**  
Chasing rainbows in the sky,  
Letâ€™s laugh, letâ€™s sing, let our spirits fly!  
With every note, we paint the air,  
Together, darling, weâ€™re a breath of flair!  

**[Hook]**  
Oh, oh, letâ€™s chase those beams of light,  
Weâ€™re the stars that sparkle so bright!
