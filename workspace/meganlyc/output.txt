**[intro] [instrumental]**  
In the stillness of the night, where dreams take flight,  
Barefoot on the path, glowing under moonlight.  
Footsteps lead to stories, lost between the stars,  
Finding whispers in the shadows, healing all our scars.  

**[verse 1]**  
Echoes of laughter float like fireflies,  
Memories hover, lighting up the skies.  
We dance on rooftops, hearts intertwined,  
Together we're a canvas, colors undefined.  

**[chorus]**  
Raise your voice, let it soar,  
In this moment, we are more.  
Together we'll create our own fate,  
In a world of wonder, it’s never too late.  

**[verse 2]**  
Chasing horizon, dreams yet untold,  
With every heartbeat, we break from the mold.  
Through the chaos and the noise, we find our way,  
Hand in hand, we'll face another day.  

**[bridge]**  
The night sings secrets wrapped in twilight's embrace,  
With every step we take, we find our place.  
Every heartbeat echoes as we navigate the dawn,  
With love as our compass, we'll keep moving on.  

**[hook]**  
Oh, we’re young, wild, and free,  
In this journey, just you and me.  
With every heartbeat, we’ll rise and thrive,  
Empowered by our dreams, we come alive.
