**Title:** Chasing Neon Dreams

**[Intro] [Instrumental]**
(Upbeat synths and groovy bass to set the playful mood)

**[Verse 1]**
Chasing dreams through neon lights,  
Weâ€™ll paint the night with our fire,  
Heartbeats sync with city vibes,  
Letâ€™s write our story, take it higher.  

**[Chorus]**  
When the stars come out to play,  
Weâ€™ll dance till the break of day,  
In this moment, it feels right,  
Together weâ€™ll set the night alight!  

**[Hook]**  
Oh-oh-oh, letâ€™s fly away,  
In this city, weâ€™ll drift and sway,  
Oh-oh-oh, hearts in the sky,  
With every heartbeat, we come alive!  

**[Verse 2]**  
Lost in rhythm, we lose our way,  
But in the chaos, we find our sway,  
Electric vibes, weâ€™ll share the thrill,  
Living for now, canâ€™t get our fill.  

**[Chorus]**  
When the stars come out to play,  
Weâ€™ll dance till the break of day,  
In this moment, it feels right,  
Together weâ€™ll set the night alight!  

**[Outro]**  
(Instrumental fade out with playful chants)  
Letâ€™s run away... letâ€™s run away...
