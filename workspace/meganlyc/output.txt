**(English)**  
**Title:** "Chasing Stars in the City"  

**(Intro) [Instrumental]**  
Let the rhythm flow, feel the energy rise,  
In the heart of the night, where our dreams harmonize.  

**(Verse 1):**  
Lost in the alleyways, echoes of laughter,  
Painting our story, each momentâ€™s a chapter.  
Collecting our memories like stars in a jar,  
With you by my side, we shine from afar.

**(Chorus):**  
Lost in the city lights, weâ€™ll chase the stars,  
A heartbeat away, no matter how far,  
In a world that whispers, we'll sing out loud,  
Together we rise, weâ€™re the bold and the proud.  

**(Verse 2):**  
Streetlights like spotlights, illuminating our way,  
Making the mundane spark joy every day.  
With our heads held high, weâ€™re dancing through the night,  
Creating a symphony, everything feels right.

**(Chorus):**  
Lost in the city lights, weâ€™ll chase the stars,  
A heartbeat away, no matter how far,  
In a world that whispers, we'll sing out loud,  
Together we rise, weâ€™re the bold and the proud.  

**(Hook):**  
So letâ€™s run wild, let the music take flight,  
With hearts unbound, weâ€™ll paint the night bright.  
Weâ€™ll chase the moonbeams, and when morning arrives,  
Weâ€™ll carry our dreams, well, that's how we thrive!

**(Outro) [Instrumental]**  
Feel the beat, let the spirit ignite,  
Weâ€™re the dreamers, dancing into the light.
