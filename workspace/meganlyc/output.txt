**Title: "Chasing Fireflies"**

**[Intro] [Instrumental]**  
*(Soft guitar strumming with gentle percussion)*

**[Verse 1]**  
In the twilight glow, we run so free,  
Laughing till we can't, just you and me.  
Whispers in the breeze, secrets in our eyes,  
Every little moment feels like a surprise.  

**[Chorus]**  
Chasing fireflies, lighting up the night,  
With hearts wide open, everything feels right.  
Let’s dance in the shadows, sing under the stars,  
In this little dream, we know just who we are.  

**[Verse 2]**  
Every shared smile, a spark to ignite,  
Your laughter's like magic, it makes everything bright.  
With dreams in our pockets, we’ll make our own way,  
Together we’ll paint the colors of the day.  

**[Chorus]**  
Chasing fireflies, lighting up the night,  
With hearts wide open, everything feels right.  
Let’s dance in the shadows, sing under the stars,  
In this little dream, we know just who we are.  

**[Hook]**  
Oh-oh, we’re running wild,  
Just a couple of kids, with the world as our style.  
Oh-oh, let the night ignite,  
With every moment captured, let’s hold on tight.  

**[Outro] [Instrumental]**  
*(Fading out with soft guitar and soothing melodies)*
