**Title: Neon Dreams**

**[Intro] [Instrumental]**  
*Sparkling synths and soft beats setting the moodâ€¦*

**[Verse 1]**  
Undergel lights, our shadows play,  
In this city, weâ€™ll find our way,  
Whispers echo, secrets weâ€™ll share,  
With every heartbeat drifting somewhere.

**[Chorus]**  
Under neon lights we dance,  
Moments fleeting, take a chance,  
Hearts entwined like morning mist,  
Lost in dreams, we can't resist.

**[Verse 2]**  
Midnight colors paint the scene,  
Laughing wild, we feel so free,  
Say the words you never knew,  
Fading worries, just me and you.

**[Chorus]**  
Under neon lights we dance,  
Moments fleeting, take a chance,  
Hearts entwined like morning mist,  
Lost in dreams, we can't resist.

**[Hook]**  
Come with me, letâ€™s chase the stars,  
Running wild, no matter how far,  
In this glow, we donâ€™t feel time,  
Lost in rhythm, your heart is mine.

**[Bridge]**  
Weâ€™ll catch the sunrise, in each other's eyes,  
Lifeâ€™s a canvas, letâ€™s paint our skies,  
Through all the chaos, weâ€™ll find our way,  
Together in this dream, letâ€™s not fade away.

**[Chorus]**  
Under neon lights we dance,  
Moments fleeting, take a chance,  
Hearts entwined like morning mist,  
Lost in dreams, we can't resist.
