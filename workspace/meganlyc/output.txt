**New Song by Megan Li**

**Title**: "Echoes in the Dark"

**[intro] [instrumental]**

**[verse 1]**  
In the shadows of the city lights,  
Running wild through the endless nights,  
Whispers echo, secrets collide,  
Feeling like we're on a rollercoaster ride.  

**[chorus]**  
We are the dreamers dancing in the dark,  
Chasing the echoes, igniting the spark,  
With every heartbeat, we’ll make our mark,  
Together we shine, tearing the night apart.  

**[verse 2]**  
Lost in moments, we’re timeless souls,  
Painting the sky with the stories we hold,  
In every heartbeat, in every sigh,  
We’ll write our anthem before we die.  

**[chorus]**  
We are the dreamers dancing in the dark,  
Chasing the echoes, igniting the spark,  
With every heartbeat, we’ll make our mark,  
Together we shine, tearing the night apart.  

**[bridge]**  
Stars above, guiding our way,  
With every note, we’ll never sway,  
In this symphony, we’ll forever stay,  
Our melody will never fade away.  

**[chorus]**  
We are the dreamers dancing in the dark,  
Chasing the echoes, igniting the spark,  
With every heartbeat, we’ll make our mark,  
Together we shine, tearing the night apart.
