**Title: Unbound Echoes**

**[Intro] [Instrumental]**
(A soft electric piano intro that builds into a rhythmic beat)

**[Verse 1]**  
"Lost in the echoes of my mind,  
Searching for pieces I canâ€™t find.  
In a world thatâ€™s buzzing loud,  
Iâ€™ll dance through the noise, unbowed."

**[Chorus]**  
"Hey, Iâ€™m unbound,  
Breaking the chains I used to wear.  
Finding my sound,  
In colors that float in the air."

**[Hook]**  
"Letâ€™s celebrate, weâ€™re alive,  
In this moment, we all thrive.  
Dare to be free, just like the stars,  
Weâ€™re writing our own memoirs."

**[Verse 2]**  
"Flipping the pages, rewriting fate,  
Shining through every twist of hate.  
Our essence sparkles in the dark,  
Together weâ€™ll light up the stark."

**[Chorus]**  
"Hey, Iâ€™m unbound,  
Breaking the chains I used to wear.  
Finding my sound,  
In colors that float in the air."

**[Outro] [Instrumental]**  
(Fading out with layered harmonies and a smooth beat)

**Music Styles:**  
Alternative R&B, Indie Pop, Neo-Soul, Chillwave, Electro-Pop
