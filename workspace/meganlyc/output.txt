**[Intro] [Instrumental]**  
*Soft synths blend with a steady beat, creating an inviting atmosphere.*

**[Verse 1]:**  
Walking through the city lights, dreams in our hands,  
Chasing all the moments that nobody understands.  
Heartbeats synced like the rhythm of the night,  
Letâ€™s break down the walls, step into the light.

---

**[Chorus]:**  
Weâ€™re the echoes of a new generation,  
No fear, just hope, pure motivation.  
Gonna ride this wave, feel the energy rise,  
In a world of chaos, weâ€™re the stars in the skies.

**[Hook]:**  
Oh-oh, weâ€™re dancing on the edge,  
Living for the now, letâ€™s make a pledge.  
Shining brighter, never looking back,  
Together weâ€™ll illuminate the track.

**[Verse 2]:**  
Masked attitudes, scrolling through the noise,  
But in this moment, weâ€™re simply just kids with poise.  
Laughing with our souls, dancing in the rain,  
Creating memories thatâ€™ll never feel in vain.

---

**[Chorus]:**  
Weâ€™re the echoes of a new generation,  
No fear, just hope, pure motivation.  
Gonna ride this wave, feel the energy rise,  
In a world of chaos, weâ€™re the stars in the skies.
