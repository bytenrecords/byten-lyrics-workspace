**Title: "Chasing Rainbows"**

**[Intro] [Instrumental]**  
*Light synths twinkling like stars, upbeat tempo begins*

**[Verse 1]**  
Woke up with the sun shining bright,  
Got my dreams dancing in the morning light.  
Chasing colors in a world so wide,  
Let's take a ride on this joyful tide.

**[Chorus]**  
Oh, we’re chasing rainbows,  
Laughing with the breeze,  
Let’s make a moment,  
Hold onto these sweet memories.  
Hands up to the sky, no shadows in sight,  
With you by my side, everything’s just right.

**[Hook]**  
Chasing rainbows, oh oh,  
Don’t let the colors fade,  
Living freely, let’s embrace,  
Every step we take—we’ve got it made!

**[Verse 2]**  
Clouds may come, but we won’t be swayed,  
Dancing through storms with the games we played.  
Hearts on fire, igniting the night,  
With a spark in our souls, we sparkle so bright.

**[Chorus]**  
Oh, we’re chasing rainbows,  
Laughing with the breeze,  
Let’s make a moment,  
Hold onto these sweet memories.  
Hands up to the sky, no shadows in sight,  
With you by my side, everything’s just right.

**[Bridge]**  
Dare to dream, just take my hand,  
We’ll soar above the rainbow land.  
In our hearts, there’s a tune so sweet,  
Life’s a melody, can’t be beat!

**[Chorus]**  
Oh, we’re chasing rainbows,  
Laughing with the breeze,  
Let’s make a moment,  
Hold onto these sweet memories.  
Hands up to the sky, no shadows in sight,  
With you by my side, everything’s just right.

*“Chasing rainbows, oh oh…”*
