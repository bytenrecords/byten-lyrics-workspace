**[Verse 1]**  
Hey there, sunshine, where do you roam?  
Iâ€™ve been dancing on clouds, calling you home.  
With every step, I feel the glow,  
Letâ€™s catch the light, let our spirits flow!  

**[Chorus]**  
Chasing sunbeams, weâ€™ll run wild and free,  
In a world full of wonders, just you and me!  
Laughing like kids, our hearts in the dye,  
Together we shine, as the stars light the sky!

Oh-oh-oh, let the laughter rise,  
Oh-oh-oh, in this joyful surprise!  

**[Verse 2]**  
Hand in hand, letâ€™s write our own song,  
Through fields of dreams, where we both belong.  
Weâ€™ll paint the sky in colors so bright,  
Living in moments that feel so right!  

**[Chorus]**  
Chasing sunbeams, weâ€™ll run wild and free,  
In a world full of wonders, just you and me!  
Laughing like kids, our hearts in the dye,  
Together we shine, as the stars light the sky!
