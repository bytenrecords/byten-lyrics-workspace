[intro] [instrumental]  
In the heart where dreams collide,  
Whispers of hopes, we can't hide.  
With every step, a fire ignites,  
Chasing the stars on endless nights.  

[verse]  
Scrolling through memories,  
Pictures frozen in time.  
Every laugh and every tear,  
Building a journey, a love sublime.  

[chorus]  
We'll rise like the sun, never retreat,  
With the rhythm of life beneath our feet.  
In this moment, we are alive,  
Chasing the echoes, we will thrive.  

[bridge]  
Through storms and shadows, weâ€™ll find our way,  
Together forever, come what may.  
Links to the past, futures in our grasp,  
In this timeless dance, we will last.
