[intro]  
[instrumental]  
In the quiet, where shadows play,  
Moonlight spills as dreams drift away.  

[verse]  
Whispers of sighs, soft and low,  
In the heart of the night, where secrets glow.  
Echoes of laughter, memories entwined,  
Every heartbeat's a story, a moment confined.  

[chorus]  
Underneath the starlit sky,  
We find our truth, never asking why.  
Dancing through the echoes, we hold on tight,  
Lost in the magic, we fade into the night.  

[hook]  
Whispers in the night, sweet and serene,  
Carried by the breeze, like a forgotten dream.  
Hold me close as the world slips away,  
In this glowing twilight, forever we’ll stay.  

[verse]  
Footprints on the sand, traces of time,  
Each step a reminder, that our souls intertwine.  
Chasing constellations, writing our tale,  
A journey unending, where love will prevail.  

[bridge]  
Let the shadows envelop, let the lullabies sing,  
In the arms of the night, hear the freedom it brings.  
Whispers of forever, promises whispered tight,  
In this sacred silence, we soar like a kite.  

[chorus]  
Underneath the starlit sky,  
We find our truth, never asking why.  
Dancing through the echoes, we hold on tight,  
Lost in the magic, we fade into the night.  

[outro]  
[instrumental]  
Whispers in the night, where we find our place,  
With every heartbeat, we embrace the space.  
In the glow of this moment, as the night takes flight,  
We’ll weave our forever, in whispers of the night.
