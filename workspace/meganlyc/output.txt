**Title:** Night Sky Dreams

**Lyrics:**

[intro] [instrumental]

[verse]  
Under the night sky, wandering free,  
Stars like diamonds, watching over me.  
Whispers of the wind, secrets untold,  
In this moment, my spirit unfolds.

[chorus]  
Hold me close, as we dance in the dark,  
Together we'll chase, ignite a spark.  
With every heartbeat, our souls intertwine,  
In this night sky, forever you're mine.

[bridge]  
Moonlight kisses, a gentle embrace,  
Lost in the magic of this sacred space.  
Time stands still, as we soar so high,  
In the arms of the universe, you and I.

[chorus]  
Hold me close, as we dance in the dark,  
Together we'll chase, ignite a spark.  
With every heartbeat, our souls intertwine,  
In this night sky, forever you're mine.

[outro] [instrumental]
