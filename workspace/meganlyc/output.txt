**Title:** Chasing the Sunset

**[Intro] [Instrumental]**

**[Verse 1]:**  
Underneath the stars, we find our way,  
Whispers in the night, weâ€™re here to play.  
With every heartbeat, we break the mold,  
In a world of colors, our story unfolds.

**[Chorus]:**  
Chasing the sunset, we dance on the edge,  
Lost in the moment, no need for a pledge.  
These nights feel electric, hearts in sync,  
Weâ€™re writing our story, just let it all ink.  

**[Hook]:**  
Whoa-oh, let it crash, let it burn,  
Feel the magic, itâ€™s our turn.  
Whoa-oh, with every dream we chase,  
Living wild in this endless space.  

**[Verse 2]:**  
Glancing at the city, lights flash like dreams,  
Never know how far, but weâ€™re bursting at the seams.  
Take a breath, feel the rhythm in our veins,  
Through laughter and tears, weâ€™ll dance in the rain.  

**[Chorus]:**  
Chasing the sunset, we dance on the edge,  
Lost in the moment, no need for a pledge.  
These nights feel electric, hearts in sync,  
Weâ€™re writing our story, just let it all ink.  

**[Bridge]:**  
In shadows we rise, together weâ€™ll soar,  
The world is our canvas, weâ€™ll paint it with more.  
Every note we play, a piece of our heart,  
Countless memories, where the magic starts.  

**[Chorus]:**  
Chasing the sunset, we dance on the edge,  
Lost in the moment, no need for a pledge.  
These nights feel electric, hearts in sync,  
Weâ€™re writing our story, just let it all ink.
