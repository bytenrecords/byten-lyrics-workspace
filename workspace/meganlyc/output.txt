**Title: Neon Dreams**

[intro]  
[Instrumental]

[verse 1]  
Underneath the stars, where our secrets hide,  
The city's heartbeat echoes, dancing side by side.  
With every wayward smile, you light up the scene,  
A spark ignites us both, like the stars that gleam.  

[chorus]  
Lost in the neon lights, we dance through the night,  
Chasing dreams too bright, weâ€™ll hold on tight.  
In this city that never sleeps, letâ€™s make memories,  
With you by my side, itâ€™s a wild ride.  

[hook]  
Hey, weâ€™re running wild,  
Throwing caution to the breeze,  
Laughing like weâ€™re children,  
Living life with ease.  

[verse 2]  
Whispers in the twilight, weâ€™re writing our fate,  
With every fleeting moment, letâ€™s not hesitate.  
The world is ours to conquer, hand in hand we glide,  
In a tapestry of magic, our hearts open wide.  

[chorus]  
Lost in the neon lights, we dance through the night,  
Chasing dreams too bright, weâ€™ll hold on tight.  
In this city that never sleeps, letâ€™s make memories,  
With you by my side, itâ€™s a wild ride.
