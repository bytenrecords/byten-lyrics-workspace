**Title: "Chasing Rainbows"**

**[intro] [instrumental]**

**[verse 1]**  
When the sun peeks through the clouds,  
A dance begins, itâ€™s feeling loud,  
Colors swirling, hearts on fire,  
Let's get lost in this sweet desire.

**[chorus]**  
Chasing rainbows, hand in hand,  
Through the valleys, across the land,  
Life's a canvas, letâ€™s paint the skies,  
With laughter ringing, dreams that rise.

**[hook]**  
Oh-oh, oh-oh, let's chase the light,  
Oh-oh, oh-oh, everything's alright!  

**[verse 2]**  
Underneath the starlit skies,  
Whispers of magic in your eyes,  
Together weâ€™ll create a song,  
With every step, where we belong.

**[chorus]**  
Chasing rainbows, hand in hand,  
Through the valleys, across the land,  
Life's a canvas, letâ€™s paint the skies,  
With laughter ringing, dreams that rise.

**[hook]**  
Oh-oh, oh-oh, let's chase the light,  
Oh-oh, oh-oh, everything's alright!
