Subject: Request for Instructions on Creating New Songs and Lyrics

Hi [Owner's Name],

I hope you're doing great! I'm excited to start creating new song lyrics for Megan. To ensure I capture your vision accurately, could you please provide me with specific instructions regarding the title, style of music, and any themes or concepts you want the lyrics to reflect?

Once I receive your guidance, I will get right to work on developing lyrics that resonate with your expectations.

Thank you for your direction!

Best,
