**Title: "Neon Nights"**

**[intro] [instrumental]**  
(Soft synths and a gentle beat)

**[verse 1]**  
When the city lights flicker, we dance in the rain,  
Lost in the moment, we shed all the pain.  
Hearts beating faster, like sparks in the night,  
Together we rise, under neon lights.

**[chorus]**  
Oh, weâ€™re electric, feel the heat,  
In this world, youâ€™re my heartbeat.  
Dreaming colors, let them flow,  
Underneath the stars, weâ€™ll let love grow.

**[hook]**  
Neon nights, weâ€™ll light the way,  
Chasing dreams, come what may.  
Laughter echoes, holding tight,  
In this magic, everything feels right.

**[verse 2]**  
Whispers in the dark, secrets to unfold,  
With you beside me, Iâ€™m never feeling cold.  
Every step a rhythm, we move to the sound,  
In our little universe, weâ€™re forever bound.

**[chorus]**  
Oh, weâ€™re electric, feel the heat,  
In this world, youâ€™re my heartbeat.  
Dreaming colors, let them flow,  
Underneath the stars, weâ€™ll let love grow.

**[hook]**  
Neon nights, weâ€™ll light the way,  
Chasing dreams, come what may.  
Laughter echoes, holding tight,  
In this magic, everything feels right.

**[outro] [instrumental]**
