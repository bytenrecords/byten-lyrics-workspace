**Title: Neon Dreams**

**[Intro] [Instrumental]**  
*Begin with a bright synth melody paired with a steady beat, creating a vibe of anticipation and excitement.*

**[Verse 1]**  
In the neon glow, where shadows dance,  
We find our truth in a restless trance.  
Whispers of dreams, like waves we ride,  
With every heartbeat, the world’s on our side.

**[Chorus]**  
Feel the rhythm of the city pulse,  
Chasing stars, we’ll never resist.  
Echoes of youth in the night we trust,  
Together we rise, it’s a must.

**[Hook]**  
Oh, lighting up the sky, we’ll break free,  
In this wild ride, you and me.  
With every twist and turn, we’ll take the leap,  
Living for now, it’s magic we keep.

**[Verse 2]**  
Through streets of color, we’ll find our way,  
Painting our dreams in shades of play.  
With every heartbeat, a story told,  
Together we’ll shine, brave and bold.

**[Chorus]**  
Feel the rhythm of the city pulse,  
Chasing stars, we’ll never resist.  
Echoes of youth in the night we trust,  
Together we rise, it’s a must.

**[Bridge]**  
Take my hand, let’s wander far,  
In the glow of a shooting star.  
With every heartbeat, our spirits soar,  
We’re not just dreaming, we’re wanting more.

**[Chorus]**  
Feel the rhythm of the city pulse,  
Chasing stars, we’ll never resist.  
Echoes of youth in the night we trust,  
Together we rise, it’s a must.

**[Outro]**  
*Fade out with ethereal vocals repeating, “Together we rise, it’s a must.”*
