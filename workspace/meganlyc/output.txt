Hey team!

I’m super thrilled about the project and Megan's fresh lyrics for "City Lights and Crown"! It captures that playful, youthful spirit that resonates with so many out there. I love the themes of self-discovery and connection woven throughout the verses and chorus. It's definitely got that relatable vibe!

Here’s an idea to expand on the concept a bit further and make it even more engaging:

---

**[Bridge]**  
*Underneath these city lights, we’re painting our dreams,*  
*With laughter in the air, nothing’s as it seems.*  
*Together we’re a force, dancing through the night,*  
*Finding magic in the chaos, shining oh-so-bright.*

Let’s make sure we keep the energy high in the production! I envision some bright, punchy beats paired with dreamy synths to create a soundscape that feels both uplifting and modern. 

Also, it might be fun to think about collaborating with a couple of fresh producers who can bring a unique perspective to the sound! 

I can’t wait to hear everyone's thoughts and ideas! Let’s keep this creative flow going!

Best,
